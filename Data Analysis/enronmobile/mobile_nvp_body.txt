mobile38	we'll let you know 
mobile39	do you want to eat lunch somewhere before

mobile45	davis had not yet updated the model for this 
mobile46	i'm thinking three and four are not as nice as five and six but that this would be okay and preferable to moving to the north tower and that we should be trying for a longer lease with breaks we can exercise at our option

mobile133	you can call me if you want or else i am going to crash 
mobile134	mostly a social call 
mobile135	we will sign tomorrow and fund tuesday

mobile140	we are all fragile 
mobile142	please forward all necessary data and models per the netco agreement

mobile147	we are delayed got another thirty minutes on the runway 
mobile148	i would like to attend if so

mobile162	i'll see you thursday october twenty fifth 
mobile163	shelley will you have time or interest in attending this informational meeting 
mobile165	i have taken the time to listen to all of your concerns and have responded below appropriately 
mobile166	do you want us to spend the money if the alternative is no content 
mobile168	my feeling is that once they affirmatively decide they are going to florida you should say that i rented a house and that you are going to come over and stay with us for a few days 
mobile169	i think that the costs may be high but i would like your evaluation of the product 
mobile170	we agreed to have a children's church meeting tacked on to the end of the next children's ministry meeting 
mobile171	obviously this is not an issue with huge time sensitivity 
mobile174	i will bring john brindle 
mobile175	so i went shopping today and saw lots of things 
mobile178	need you or john to step out 
mobile179	we probably have to discuss trade behavior and margin 
mobile180	we will meet you at six thirty even if john is late 
mobile181	also spoke with joe gold and he can be ready to move his three hundred million dollars quickly through barclays as well 
mobile182	chad thought we were on a treasure hunt 
mobile183	i thought i sent jim an email over the weekend 
mobile184	can't get anyone at enron to think that far ahead 
mobile185	but i have been reading my emails along the way and know about all the meetings next week 
mobile187	you can explain this to me next week or over the weekend 
mobile189	i did talk to connie the travel broker and she said that she was just holding our visa stuff pending instructions from chris ivins 
mobile190	by the way i met yesterday with an internal candidate who did not have requisite experience 
mobile193	he would love anything about rocks 
mobile194	i totally understand but we now have a real problem with regard to the timeline 
mobile198	what do you hear 
mobile199	i have received many replies that the message is undeliverable 
mobile200	i asked what dan will be doing but the person i talked to didn't know 
mobile201	thanks i needed that today 
mobile202	i will review them on monday 
mobile203	maybe i should just stay there for good 
mobile204	i think the benefits information already is in what we sent to katie caplan as well 
mobile205	my only constraint is chad's noon soccer game 
mobile206	no problem maria please contact rick 
mobile209	i will try and arrange to sit down and look at the most recent numbers 
mobile210	a bit behind on my emails 
mobile211	then we can go to zainy brainy 
mobile212	hope your trip to florida was good 
mobile216	hi how are things there 
mobile217	what is your issue sir 
mobile220	what a nice note 
mobile221	i told gary you could make the call 
mobile223	i would rather fund seven days in advance each monday 
mobile224	i think we should consider this request 
mobile225	i'm supposed to talk to ben and steve today 
mobile227	greg is not back yet either so we still don't know real numbers 
mobile231	i'll check around i have a good friend who works there 
mobile233	i'm on my way back there to do so 
mobile234	i have no way of seeing the slide on my blackberry 
mobile235	bound to be some media flack on this 
mobile240	be back tomorrow and maybe we can visit 
mobile243	i know this might push us to the point of her asking whether they can stay with us but i'm afraid the kids will spill the beans 
mobile245	neal can you help with this 
mobile246	haedicke has given me travis and mary cook as legal and i understand they are digging through the contracts 
mobile253	best of luck and stay in touch 
mobile255	john thanks for the update 
mobile259	until we can answer these questions we cannot terminate anything 
mobile260	i was answering janet's comment 
mobile262	so should i drive tomorrow 
mobile264	how would you explain the difference between the two 
mobile265	suffice it to say all of these things will be taken care of before it funds 
mobile267	do you think you will need me to come back into the office tonight 
mobile269	if so send me an email and i will come up before i leave for the hanger 
mobile270	i have a favor to ask 
mobile274	i'm still in dallas 
mobile276	we are on the road to palacios 
mobile277	we told them that we were keen to deal but needed commitment 
mobile281	it reads like she is in 
mobile282	oh my perhaps i've given you the wrong idea about the sophistication of chad's rock collection 
mobile283	is cassandra there today 
mobile284	let us know if you have suggestions on a replacement 
mobile286	heather tells me there are only two remaining issues so i'll follow up on those 
mobile287	i like nick and everett 
mobile288	shouldn't be too hard though 
mobile289	i saw an offer letter to teresa staab so if we didn't give it to her it's on the reserve list somewhere 
mobile290	in a couple of weeks 
mobile291	has dynegy made a specific request 
mobile292	i am walking in now 
mobile294	they have capacity now 
mobile296	i am here today i am in stan's staff meeting 
mobile297	unfortunately we do not know what the deal is 
mobile299	will he come down wetheimer 
mobile300	i will call in twenty to thirty minutes 
mobile302	did you add the sections on what we want newco to do for the employees 
mobile305	we are still transitioning and alina had a fit as we were leaving a friend's house to come to choir 
mobile306	if the reimbursement doesn't show up then there is no offset and the dollars spent should end up in rate base 
mobile309	she had your name on the list she pulled so i am confused 
mobile310	a gift isn't necessary 
mobile311	we are planning to attend although i am going to a networking happy hour at my old firm 
mobile313	tell her to get my expense report done 
mobile314	i am out of town on business tonight 
mobile318	we need a process to deal with this 
mobile319	i'm waiting until she comes home 
mobile322	see you next week 
mobile323	this is the neatest toy i have had 
mobile324	it was in a yellow interoffice envelope real yellow not the regular manila colored 
mobile326	i offered to form up a study effort with them since they would be a crucial shipper 
mobile328	i heard we had preliminary good feedback from cadwalader on pledging contracts 
mobile329	chris foster is in 
mobile331	and we can send out an email on our staff meeting on monday 
mobile332	i've been thinking about them for several weeks and haven't made up my mind 
mobile333	no but thanks 
mobile334	they are more efficiently pooled 
mobile335	this isn't the language that we agreed on and it will cause serious objections from my camp 
mobile336	i will send them a letter telling them that we will be covering 
mobile337	i have other things to worry about 
mobile338	we'll be in state college around july fourth 
mobile340	hole is unlikely but is a real weak point in any sales discussion 
mobile341	i may take the opportunity to run some errands 
mobile342	this is a problem for timing of restart 
mobile343	i will call you monday morning to discuss 
mobile344	let's discuss in the morning 
mobile346	thanks for yours and donna's efforts to get this before i left 
mobile347	i should be back in the office on wednesday 
mobile349	same camp as davies lagrasta 
mobile352	i didn't understand we were borrowing them 
mobile354	if he does not have it we will have to call trailblazer directly 
mobile355	as a further indication of their confidence the deal team is spending three days in vail this week with family to recuperate 
mobile357	michelle tells me their law firm is drafting changes to agreement as we speak 
mobile358	just send the package to kevin we just need backup not presentations 
mobile362	i think tim wants to move quickly 
mobile363	if motley is in we are out of money 
mobile365	i'm on a vacation day but have to stop by the office later today and will round these up 
mobile366	please let james and kathy know 
mobile367	i want to thank everyone involved 
mobile368	please feel free to call me on my cell at seven one three three zero two five five two two or at home at seven one three two one eight seven one five five if you need to reach me urgently 
mobile369	having said that though the underlying inventory items would have to be evaluated by the lenders for residual value and liquidity 
mobile370	what period does the max rate assumption cover 
mobile374	there is a meeting in omaha we are attending on wednesday with mary kay and dave 
mobile376	i'm open though 
mobile379	forward it in to steve for approval 
mobile380	still views that mark is out greg is temporary and stan is here for the company for better or worse 
mobile381	let me know if the plan is different 
mobile382	the price they paid recognized the debt was there if it is not there the price will be higher 
mobile385	producers reacting to price management 
mobile386	please see if you can find an eight hundred number for lincoln life central for filing a life insurance claim 
mobile390	i will be listening in for a little while 
mobile391	it has been very rough this week 
mobile392	i'll sign it in counterpart then i'll find a fax somewhere and fax it back to you 
mobile393	surely we can cover this from within virgo's team 
mobile395	just wanted to touch base 
mobile396	not like you'll get paid for it 
mobile397	i am getting home early 
mobile398	i would suggest that we tweak the language in the third paragraph to say that we remain willing to provide feedback instead of saying that we would like to 
mobile399	thanks again for your help 
mobile401	i'll be thinking of you 
mobile402	has brian had his contract yet 
mobile404	could you try ringing her 
mobile405	what a crazy day

mobile408	you didn't answer me about driving tomorrow 
mobile409	do you need it today 
mobile410	i intend to distribute something this week

mobile416	steve gilbert is working on this 
mobile423	what is going on 
mobile425	your kind thoughts are appreciated

mobile431	i will be thinking of you 
mobile434	john this message concerns me 
mobile435	did we plan that 
mobile436	the pedicure needs to be with someone else so it's at the same time 
mobile437	this will make my week 
mobile438	i'm leaving around noon tomorrow to catch a flight 
mobile439	i am glad that things are going well 
mobile441	i already had donna prepare a revised budget with people assigned directly to pipes and no cross pipe allocations 
mobile442	need anything from target 
mobile443	in the current environment i am less than confident i could sell the unsecured enron piece shortly 
mobile444	lynn and steve will attend for me 
mobile445	given the prior understanding we had that this transaction did not require board approval i do not think we can or should ask for that approval now 
mobile446	do we need to meet before the meeting with socal 
mobile448	i will be late on day one 
mobile450	assume for now that we are running identical trading books as it should be easy to cut the ones we do not want 
mobile452	i think i get this everyday now

mobile455	i forgot to send the address list before we left for austin 
mobile456	today has been hard for me

mobile484	i'll get you details 
mobile485	do you and george have a thing going

mobile514	i have been in contact with him and he is familiar with the issues

mobile518	i know he has a lot going and doesn't have the crystal ball that i and others are looking for 
mobile519	what is happening to the stock price 
mobile521	we have the data 
mobile524	once you do you can never go back 
mobile526	should i bring you something back 
mobile530	moved to the seventh 
mobile532	however before we do anything i need to see what you are proposing and visit with rod

mobile564	suggest you get facts before judging anyone 
mobile565	i am now officially a blackberry addict 
mobile566	have i mentioned how much i love houston traffic 
mobile567	i would prefer that they have individual logins so we can audit who did what 
mobile569	take what you can get 
mobile571	boy i couldn't write too much on this thing 
mobile572	i have no documents on this transaction 
mobile574	evidently waiver was received but prohibits us from selling assets or prepaying debt without their approval 
mobile575	and yes i am learning how to use the blackberry reasonably well 
mobile576	should systems manage the migration 
mobile577	yes belize is supposed to be very good also but the island we would be going to is practically in belize

mobile582	need before board meeting 
mobile584	i would like to have a pedicure every four weeks at the same time as my manicure 
mobile585	i am going to go to work tomorrow but i dread it 
mobile586	i think we should stick to customer figures rather than mix customer and contract stats 
mobile587	i've got a call into bowen 
mobile588	i think that is the right answer 
mobile589	we've attached conditions to our commitment that i'd like to preserve 
mobile590	next time ask jim to call me

mobile625	i went to see a doctor 
mobile628	hope you don't freeze tonight 
mobile629	i want to verify with litigation that the scope of the lawsuits regarding the el paso swaps would preclude their inclusion in a master netting agreement

mobile657	yes we need to get it in asap 
mobile658	i am snowed under and out of the office 
mobile659	i plan to be in the office tomorrow 
mobile661	i know it doesn't help much but i'm not sure what you can tell everyone at this point 
mobile666	is this because we have not rolled two thousand one actuals in and thru two thousand two plan 
mobile670	but it is quite powerful for communications and managing a group while traveling 
mobile671	i'll just have her call tracy 
mobile674	i am looking forward to the salad 
mobile675	could you make a doctor's appointment for tomorrow for the doctor on level three

mobile700	i wish he would leave deerfield alone 
mobile701	are you joining us for the one thirty on drew's office 
mobile702	i told you silly 
mobile703	i know it is our core business but it might be quicker than selling brazil 
mobile704	i had specifically taken this deal to jeff for approval and he had decided to not go forward at that point in time 
mobile706	wednesday is definitely a hot chocolate day 
mobile707	can you do the gallup contracts as well 
mobile708	apologize to steve dowd for me 
mobile709	thanks for your concern 
mobile712	hillis set up a room if you would like to attend 
mobile713	thursday works better for me

mobile717	will reveal as appropriate 
mobile720	use cell for next forty minutes and then use home if you need me 
mobile721	chase back office and their restart plan updates individually 
mobile723	lynn checked with fran and she told her coordinator

mobile1180	i think that is right but i do not have the data to confirm that

mobile1187	let him pursue his claims with everyone else

mobile1224	had conference calls with godfrey lamb and mitchell on indian mesa two

mobile1228	i gather you heard about six to seven for cornhusker for this quarter

mobile1232	it is probably a good idea to go and stay downtown 
mobile1235	it consists of rocks he has picked up at the park and a few gems he bought at a museum 
mobile1237	we are working on it but in the grand scheme of things it is kind of a back burner issue

mobile1343	i'm quite interested as i told lyn 
mobile1344	either we call every commercial person a trader or we periodically acknowledge the existence of marketers 
mobile1345	also the last sentence of that paragraph should ask whether she would like to pursue that option instead of asking about her availability

mobile1646	approximately half is due to organic cash flow 
mobile1647	i haven't had a conversation on this since nineteen ninety nine 
mobile1650	i'm working on a liquidity forecast 
mobile1651	if we don't get it could be trouble

mobile1655	is there any way to just reduce the expenses for now 
mobile1656	are you being a baby 
mobile1657	so if we are going on a weekend why are you telling robyn

mobile1663	he also will have to honor noncompete 
mobile1664	bill and maria please plan on calling in if at all possible 
mobile1667	as to solicitation of employees back and forth it will be a negotiated deal term 
mobile1668	i believe that now that we have signed there is no condition precedent that will allow for the board to say no to the deal 
mobile1669	kind of like silent fireworks 
mobile1670	would you please give me a call at your earliest convenience 
mobile1671	can you get with mary and make sure

mobile1688	has there been any announcements on the dynegy deal 
mobile1689	i was going to call you but i hate to bother your holiday 
mobile1690	remember blackberry doesn't work so well at home 
mobile1692	he will walk tanya rohauer through the exact same steps tomorrow 
mobile1694	at this point in time dynegy will be responsible for this debt if they exercise their rights under the preferred stock agreements which would leave them with common pledged to the lenders 
mobile1695	i don't have the distraction of taking care of mimi 
mobile1696	i think afraid of mass exodus 
mobile1700	could you see where this stands 
mobile1701	unless you really believe that you can pull off richard's project which sounds huge 
mobile1702	we will need to get your signature on a few docs 
mobile1703	did we get from lisa the appropriate internal account opening form from lisa yet 
mobile1704	meet at arriving passenger area at lower level 
mobile1706	sorry for the unfriendly greeting in the lobby

mobile1710	yes i like perfume 
mobile1711	i'm going to class 
mobile1712	i have got to get out there as you can appreciate 
mobile1713	i was wondering if i could use some of the frozen veggies to make a casserole 
mobile1716	see you on the third 
mobile1718	smaller ad hoc meetings are more appropriate until the marketing agreements are finalized 
mobile1719	hey so should we be nervous about kori coming back on monday 
mobile1720	did we get ours back 
mobile1721	she indicated that the indemnities in the contribution agreement covered the matters addressed in this draft and that she was told no more indemnities were to be made 
mobile1722	i will be traveling out of the country next week 
mobile1724	the rate case settlement represented a compromise approach to shifting more responsibility to the peak 
mobile1725	diane has info from littler on its proposed training 
mobile1726	let's leave it until we get going 
mobile1728	they both have the sniffles and i have a sore throat 
mobile1730	i think we have credit working on seventy seven and we should start compiling the next list 
mobile1731	i realize this is short notice but if you don't have lunch plans for tuesday i'd love it if you could join kay mann and me for lunch at damians 
mobile1732	do you have a number for him 
mobile1738	i wasn't able to use the global phone in kazakhstan 
mobile1740	i'll call you in the morning 
mobile1741	i am afraid dan would worry if he knew about julia unless she has left him a message 
mobile1742	can talk about one more if needed 
mobile1743	we are all doing reasonably well i think 
mobile1744	i may be in tomorrow too after i make sure alina won't freak out with the babysitter 
mobile1746	the other figure is the top fifteen contracts 
mobile1747	yes please explain that eight need doctor's signature so she can start preschool tuesday 
mobile1751	go for the dollars 
mobile1752	i do wish i knew 
mobile1754	she was leaving omaha for houston at four o'clock 
mobile1755	i'll need to come back soon but i think it is time for me to go 
mobile1757	should i go ahead and make hotel and car reservations for california 
mobile1758	i didn't think we had 
mobile1760	i called tom at eight thirty this morning 
mobile1761	we think it may be payable as a past expense 
mobile1764	so i need your spreadsheets asap 
mobile1766	i have a doctor's appointment for eleven o'clock on tuesday 
mobile1767	do you need to be there 
mobile1768	let me know if i need to make adjustments 
mobile1769	hope you had a good weekend 
mobile1770	had we not run into the el paso issues the number would have held 
mobile1773	that would be a good idea 
mobile1774	i hate not being there but i think these other meetings are big enough to have presence in omaha 
mobile1777	i am on your calendar tomorrow afternoon and can explain further 
mobile1778	east coast should be essentially flat 
mobile1779	how's the share price 
mobile1780	shelly there will be no one from my group unless i go up to meet with minnegasco 
mobile1782	i guess we are almost there right

mobile1807	she was going to leave at eight or nine 
mobile1809	november fourteenth works for me 
mobile1811	their lead won't tell me over the phone but we are schedule to get together at lunch to discuss 
mobile1815	i think as long as enron is performing i'm not sure why there is all of this noise 
mobile1816	also it appears no payment is required tomorrow 
mobile1818	it will be very quiet all week 
mobile1820	i forgot one person when we spoke on friday 
mobile1822	i didn't know what her new title was supposed to be 
mobile1826	i will need to have my memory refreshed

mobile1841	i'm out of office till wednesday 
mobile1842	please send tomy direct reports

mobile1846	danny i recommended on monday we cancel it 
mobile1847	if so whitt is done 
mobile1848	if he wants it 
mobile1849	this is the second year in a row kevin has backed out on interviewing at the last minute 
mobile1850	i appreciate your questions and comments and await your reply

mobile1859	i can't get online only blackberry but got gist of message 
mobile1861	can you resend me the doyle email from last week 
mobile1862	if so what was it 
mobile1863	i'm in stan's office 
mobile1866	it's death or dynegy with no clear leader 
mobile1867	i don't think they formally backed out but effectively that is what has happened 
mobile1868	forty million dollars in by tuesday 
mobile1871	i think he is utility player that can fill several roles but if your team won't need help i'm not sure if i need him 
mobile1872	if you already have forwarded the memo please pass along the warning and ask them not to forward again 
mobile1875	we will be managing our rates and we need to plan on software 
mobile1876	invite frank laura tycholiz lagrasta breslau duran forster calger and foster

mobile1880	we in the process of making a change 
mobile1881	if you need john speak up now 
mobile1883	we will not decide till next week as you know 
mobile1884	john it may be best we can achieve here is an indicative draft which we talk with top twenty about and tee them up for real thing circa january tenth 
mobile1885	in isolation all of these things are trivial 
mobile1886	is there anything major going on 
mobile1887	the troops just walked in 
mobile1888	don't forget the wood 
mobile1889	it is no problem 
mobile1890	we need to give them a defined group for day one 
mobile1893	i'm available by cell when you get data points 
mobile1894	we are somewhat emasculated bystanders 
mobile1895	but we should pay them the four thousand five hundred 
mobile1896	did you budget to use the company plane in two thousand two 
mobile1899	this seems fine to me 
mobile1900	i need a chauffeur when we arrive to take us either to king's cross to get a train or go all the way home

mobile1919	let's make sure we have all bases covered and telephone tree in place

mobile1924	rick i have a number of contracts that the bankers want early tomorrow 
mobile1927	i'm about to return to the office to see it 
mobile1928	they played dirty michael hung tough

mobile1937	so it is all in ginger's hands now 
mobile1939	i have thirty minutes then 
mobile1940	mikey is invited also

mobile1986	after that meeting dari mary and i are going to review procedures for any changes 
mobile1988	if jeff says it is okay then i take comfort in that given my relationship with jeff 
mobile1990	i have received your messages and will respond accordingly 
mobile1991	i make this about fifteen full time people and probably the equivalent of another seven to ten for these other functions plus their expenses 
mobile1995	i likely will be arriving late so probably should pass 
mobile1996	i'm not close enough right now to the discussion 
mobile1998	bill is doing a great job on this 
mobile1999	we may need more logins if there are multiple people required to schedule 
mobile2000	then they should go home 
mobile2002	brian is working this
