From: joseph.deffner@enron.com
To: louise.kitchen@enron.com
Subject: 

Chuck's numbers he walked you through earlier assumed 100 BPS in fees so we are slightly better than forecast.
The 65 BPS was computed for the original transaction for which we drafted dox and received ratings from S&P and Moody's.
Had we not run into the El Paso issues the number would have held.
Given that the new structure requires a new market, new rating agency process and new documentation, we are effectively documenting and selling a new second transaction.
An increase in the fee for this substantial change of the deal is market.
I still believe a September 30 closing is unrealistic.
If all goes well, I think we can be done by mid October.
To reach a September 30 closing, I think the only option would be to ask bank of America to underwrite and buy the whole thing.
That would likely be an expensive option.
We can discuss in much more detail at our 9 AM meeting tomorrow.
I'd be hesitant to show panic that we must sell the asset at any price prior to September 30 and trade real economic value and negotiate from a weaker position when we can have a clean sale two weeks later (ideally before 3Q earnings release).
The assets are still warehoused off balance sheet and fortunately El Paso's credit spreads have been trading in to our benefit.
Just my thoughts.
PS: your gift made my day.
I'm fully recovered and back on pace.
Thanks.

The view now is to minimize costs and move toward a sale of our A to B rights as a withdrawn partner to WMB or TCPL, or we may negotiate a deal that would allow us a back in interest if we pay a promote at a given point in the future.
Either way we will limit further funds from going out the door.

In general if a person turns down an offer to go to a divested company, it is considered a voluntary termination/resignation.
We haven't made that decision here though. 
As to solicitation of employees back and forth, it will be a negotiated deal term.
I can't recall if we put any provision on that issue in the bid template or not.
Let me know if you want me to check the latest version.

Mostly a social call.
Brief discussion on noise in the market he's hearing and reading, etc.
He walked me through outstanding issues on Alamac that he is working with Duran and Heather to resolve.
Heather tells me there are only two remaining issues so I'll follow up on those.
I suggested rather than buying assets from us (Alamac), he should be ready for us to ask him to co-invest alongside us if we need equity partners in transactions (BNY, Cogentrix, UAE, etc - didn't discuss any particular deals).
Told him we'd expect him to turn the deals quickly.
He's ready and willing to be here any day we have something to discuss with him.
I can fill you in on more details later.
Budget allocation from Glisan has been postponed.
I will let you know the outcome when it's resolved.

Skyline refers to added seasonality that NNG proposed to add to its rates.
The rate case settlement represented a compromise approach to shifting more responsibility to the peak.
So no we didn't implement Skyline as proposed and nothing is pending.
I expect that NNG will make a new proposal to reflect peak cost responsibility as part of the next rate case.

Yes.
They want us to record the amounts loaned, normal loans, as a reduction of equity, if ENE does not currently have the ability to repay from either cash or other assets or credit capability.
They do not want to count the 1.5B or the bank loans since they will simply increase the size of the notes.

I would suggest that we tweak the language in the third paragraph to say that we remain willing to provide feedback, instead of saying that we would like to.
Also, the last sentence of that paragraph should ask whether she would like to pursue that option instead of asking about her availability.
Finally, I would delete the paragraph about lawyers.

I'm not familiar with the individual assets (might include gaspart and ceg/rio) of that structure but the critical asset apparently is a $690m loan to Enron.
When Enron hit BBB-rating, Rawhide was no longer allowed to lend to Enron and called the note due.
There was a Rawhide bankers meeting late yesterday to consider Enron's request to delay the call by several weeks.
Neither Bowen nor myself know if any decision has been reached by the lenders at this time.

Mahonia transaction is one way margin only because Mahonia has already prepaid their leg of the transaction so there is never a scenario where the floating leg would be less than the fixed leg (which has been bought down to 0) so margining is not possible in that direction.
As prices fall we effectively begin to repay the transaction.
We can follow up in more detail later on the structure but we will also work on mitigating the margin required due to falling prices as the pipe deal closes and resources can be redeployed.

Subject: Re: ERC Financing

With regards to the existing deal, the setup costs and timeline was primarily the result of working out the kinks on legal/accounting structures to find a deal structure both sides could live with.
I would hope costs would be lower on future additions.
Having said that, though, the underlying inventory items would have to be evaluated by the lenders for residual value and liquidity.
To the degree the underlying asset would support less than book value upon a quick liquidation, the put/call price protection embeds more Enron risk in the financing.
In the current environment, I am less than confident I could sell the unsecured Enron piece shortly.
Jim, can you stay point on this exercise for the ERCS and other items?
Thanks.

I think we should try to sell some of our in the money positions.
Bradford did not want to pursue this when we were doing the ring trades for AEP, but now it seems as though we should do it simply to raise cash.  
#If we are short NP15 and we have an in the money sale to a muni that does not #post collateral, we could sell that customer contract to cash-rich marketers - #Allegheny, Duke, AEP, Dynegy.
I know it is our core business, but it might be quicker than selling Brazil.

Subject: Update

Shelly, just wanted to update you on a few things.
Steve and I have been asked to work with McGown and Steve Kirk on the SLA settlement.
There is a meeting in Omaha we are attending on Wednesday with Mary Kay and Dave.
There is a marketing issue in relation to NNG procedures on monitoring stranger's gas.
There is a meeting Thursday morning with Dave and Mary Kay.
After that meeting Dari, Mary and I are going to review procedures for any changes. 
I will conference in for Thursday's customer service meeting.
I hate not being there but I think these other meetings are big enough to have presence in Omaha.
The SoCal meeting was very beneficial.
Only one possible variance from what we had previously heard.
There is a possibility SoCal could reduce capacity at ID2.  
Pat and I talked about TW concerns.
I will review with marketing and the team when I get back.
I love my Blackberry, but still getting used to typing on it.
Anxious to hear how the paging worked for you.
Hope your trip to Florida was good.
Also hope you can make sense of this email.
Thanks, Lynn.

Subject: RE: honduras

Thank you for your prompt reply.
I have taken the time to listen to all of your concerns and have responded below appropriately. 
My "need" would more appropriately be characterized as a "desire" (something that, according to my Buddhism class yesterday, would be beneficial to give up if I want to achieve true happiness).
The desire, however, is related to the possibility of spending a fair amount of time in diving locations during my honeymoon.
Due to the limited amount of vacation time I am allotted from my employer, I am going to find it necessary to forego all vacation opportunities for the next 10 months (other than this week between Christmas and New Years) and hence find it necessary to use the specified time to obtain the coveted certification.
No, I am not interested in getting certified in Monterey Bay. 
As far as I know the weather is quite pleasant year round.
I know the place we intend to go is on an island off the eastern coast of Honduras.
I hope to provide you with a more detailed answer after consulting reliable travel guides and weather almanacs. 
The diving is supposed to be quite "killer" (as you put it).
I have a direct recommendation from my travel obsessed friend, Jessica, who just got certified there a couple months ago and has provided me with both information and endorsements.
Yes, Belize is supposed to be very good also, but the island we would be going to is practically in Belize.
Please refer to a map of Honduras (which shall be provided at a later date). 
I appreciate your questions and comments and await your reply. 
Sincerely,
Cameron

In the European CSFB prepay which was just extended, Morgan Stanley was also involved for a related swap of the same amount.
I think CSFB was aware of that on the euro prepay.
Has it been mentioned yet?
Treasa knows the details.
I wonder if RBS is another institution which could move quickly.
They have capacity now.
