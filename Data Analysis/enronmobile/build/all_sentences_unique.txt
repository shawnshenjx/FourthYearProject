Thinks PWR suppliers in California should be worried about getting paid the long term contracts rates.
Need you or John to step out.
Didn't get a commitment.
Just told them I thought it would be impossible.
Are you joining us for the 1:30 on Drew's office?
What is our cash needs over the week to ten days?
Ned for McMahon meeting at 1.
This relates to a junior assistant who has been part of my group.
Who should I contact regarding severance? 
FYI.
I will circle back with everyone later today.
We will sign tomorrow and fund Tuesday.
Pie chart slide for AZ, NM, and NEV shows the source of info to be the "Arizona Corporation Commission".
Who is this?
Dan Boyle mentioned that today is the deadline for the Rawhide amendment.
If we don't get it, could be trouble.
We will address tomorrow with Stan.
Tax gave us the same feedback.
Davis had not yet updated the model for this. 
Thanks.
I am fine with this.
If Jeff says it is okay, then I take comfort in that given my relationship with Jeff.
I will follow up with him as soon as the dust settles.
Thanks - that's what I was hoping it was.
Heading in to see Moody's.
Thanks again for your help.
Agreed
I will call you Monday morning to discuss.
What is the status of the Pemex discussions?
When Dan mentions MLP, is he referring to using border or setting up a new one?
Is Stan looking for a go / no go decision?
Banks want to exclude goodwill.
How would you explain the difference between the two?
I will be there.
Today
Evidently, waiver was received but prohibits us from selling assets or prepaying debt without their approval.
I will try to get a copy of the waiver.
Chase waiting to issue press release stating ENE has received the amendment and that we have closed and funded our NNG deal.
Thanks!
Jim:
These assets are still owned, controlled and consolidated on ENE's balance sheet.
This financing shows up as minority interest.
I am on your calendar tomorrow afternoon and can explain further.
I do not believe that we are in violation of any transfer restrictions.
Thanks for the quick turnaround.
I will take a look at this today.
Why aren't we using the lower CAPEX number with the lower rates?
Let's start with this and add more later.
We need to bring them along slowly.
Thanks again for all of your help in this effort. 
Is this in addition to the one with Dan at 1:30?
Yes.
Where?
Kevin
I have a meeting on Tuesday from 1-4 with Stan.
Is this the only time available?
Kim
I appreciate you moving so quickly on this.
However, before we do anything, I need to see what you are proposing and visit with Rod.
We will need to get your signature on a few docs.
Should we email this to you or fax to your house?
I am not concerned with the Brown money.
My focus is on possibly dislodging money for Orlando.
I will try and arrange to sit down and look at the most recent numbers.
They will be getting new results over the weekend and it should be indicative of trends.
In my car on the way to the office from the airport.
I am snowed under and out of the office.
Kay Mann is going to take the lead on this.
I am forwarding all the emails to her attention.
Should I go ahead and make hotel and car reservations for California?
I'd be happy to.
Yes, I will do so.
I will try to reach you on Wednesday. 
Don't make me pull tapes on whether you understood our fee.
JA always understands.
Happy to help you guys anyways (I know you'll thank me later).
J. Robert Collins
BCollins@NYMEX.com
I will call in 20 to 30 minutes.
Interesting, are you around for a late lunch?
Pretty impressive win!
Hopefully it cheered you up a bit. 
Bill 
Sure.
But, we typically send a PDF file that contains all of our info by email. 
Cameron
Thank you for your prompt reply.
I have taken the time to listen to all of your concerns and have responded below appropriately.
Question 1: my "need" would more appropriately be characterized as a "desire" (something that, according to my Buddhism class yesterday, would be beneficial to give up if I want to achieve true happiness).
The desire, however, is related to the possibility of spending a fair amount of time in diving locations during my honeymoon.
Due to the limited amount of vacation time I am allotted from my employer, I am going to find it necessary to forego all vacation opportunities for the next 10 months (other than this week between Christmas and New Years) and hence find it necessary to use the specified time to obtain the coveted certification.
No, I am not interested in getting certified in Monterey Bay.
Question 2: As far as I know the weather is quite pleasant year round.
I know the place we intend to go is on an island off the eastern coast of
Honduras.
I hope to provide you with a more detailed answer after consulting reliable travel guides and weather almanacs.
Question 3: The diving is supposed to be quite "killer" (as you put it).
I have a direct recommendation from my travel obsessed friend, Jessica, who just got certified there a couple months ago and has provided me with both information and endorsements.
Yes, Belize is supposed to be very good also, but the island we would be going to is practically in Belize.
Please refer to a map of Honduras (which shall be provided at a later date). 
I appreciate your questions and comments and await your reply. 
Sincerely,
Scotty and I will be in NYC. 
I'm glad you liked it.
I hoped you did. 
See you on Friday.
Wish me luck with Linda. 
Cool!
Could I ask the two of you to please insure that there is a refreshed view on the legal risks relative to both our and El Paso's litigation on East Coast Power.
If this has already been covered, then I apologize.
I just want to make sure Louise has the best data points for making a decision on my proposal of this morning.  
Thanks,
Chuck Ward
I gather you heard about 6 to 7 for Cornhusker for this quarter.
East Coast should be essentially flat.
Any questions about these items and you can typically get the quickest estimate or actual from me.
We do need to discuss ECP debt today if you're available.
Chuck
I heard through the grapevine that El Paso had an emergency BOD meeting on Friday.
They did.
There is some type of retrade underway from the Bill Wise level.
Their lead won't tell me over the phone but we are schedule to get together at lunch to discuss.
He says he has some ideas.
Could be a range of things but he seems to be noting timing (maybe they are tapped out for cash).
Did not take the chance to tell about the outage.
Will reveal as appropriate.
Dave - please call Larry and find out what is up before I speak with David Field.
Joe and Henry - could you please do the same with Andrew?
I'm available by cell when you get data points.
7133042519
Zero to five percent.
It would be similar to having the BOD of Enron turning down a project with Frevert, Kitchen and Duran support with a signed dash.
Unless the BOD is planning on a new CEO, this is unlikely to happen.
As a further indication of their confidence, the deal team is spending three days in Vail this week, with family, to recuperate.
You have approval to submit a request to the cash committee via Doug Sewell.
Chip Schneider
Mike, I'm afraid I have a conflict in San Diego on behalf of Ken Lay those days.
FYI, I'll be on campus this Monday meeting with Tom Piazze and Donna Piazze at 3 and 4 PM and assisting with interviewing undergrads for Enron Tuesday, in case we need to discuss anything in person.
Christie.
Louise,
I think we should try to sell some of our in the money positions.
Bradford did not want to pursue this when we were doing the ring trades for AEP, but now it seems as though we should do it simply to raise cash.  
I know it is our core business, but it might be quicker than selling Brazil. 
Target customers: Munis, Wapa, BPA.
Amanda day.
Danny I recommended on Monday we cancel it.
Ken agreed yesterday.
Shelley,
I'm currently at the loading dock loading equipment for the hanger.
Did you have any questions regarding the GMS cost numbers I gave you yesterday?
If so send me an email and I will come up before I leave for the hanger.
We will make some minor changes at the hanger but we will leave it up and ready to go.
Dale
I have the cable now if you are still here. 
Daniel A. Muschar
Trader Support Group
Eric,
Call me ASAP. 
Dan
Rod,
We were just downgraded to B- by S and P.
I think it's over now.  
Rod, 
What is going on?
Every day there is something new, different, and bad about us.
Now, the rumor in Houston is that we are filing Chapter 11 on Monday.
Is everything out, or is there more to come (Kilmer is about ready to blow an artery)?
Still views that Mark is out, Greg is temporary, and Stan is here for the company, for better or worse.
What do you hear?
Steve,
I received the message from Rod on California demand.
Are Linde and Kim available to assist Rod?
See also if we can get something from Lorna Brennan.
Let me know if there is any kind of problem in responding to Rod. 
Hi Sue.
Boy, I couldn't write too much on this thing!
Too tiny!
Dan wanted to tell you that there is leftover potato casserole on the top shelf of the fridge.
Help yourself.
I guess that's it for now.
Hope you don't freeze tonight. 
Love, Judy.
FYI
Contact me tomorrow at 3032788492 prior to emailing me the document as discussed below.
Got it.
Never mind. 
Julie, 
Do you have a number for Steve?  
Dave,
I am still uncomfortable doing anything with NNG's swaps until someone can tell me who the swaps are with, who the confirms are with, what underlying contracts are being terminated, and what are the ramifications of the termination.
Until we can answer these questions, we cannot terminate anything.
How can we get these answers?
I love you.
Cool is it not. 
Email the consent to me.
I'll sign it in counterpart, then I'll find a fax somewhere and fax it back to you.
Email me at tcsjws@aol.com.
Call me to give me a heads up. 
Are you not hearing back from my people on this?
If not, Julie and I will track them down this afternoon. 
I just tracked down Steve.
He is at 281 350 8441. 
He's checking his email now and is expecting your call. 
Gary made it sound like you had decided to lose Michael.
For my money, I think if we kept Michael, we could get rid of all of our analysts and associates, and still handle our development deals and sales.
The view now is to minimize costs and move toward a sale of our A to B rights as a withdrawn partner to WMB or TCPL, or we may negotiate a deal that would allow us a back in interest if we pay a promote at a given point in the future.
Either way we will limit further funds from going out the door. 
I'll be somewhere between Pueblo and the Royal Gorge, but I'll try to stop and patch in.
I trust that everyone already understands what is contracted and the only concern is our recontracting capability.
Right?
Deb,
Take what you can get. 
Jared,
Starting when?
Mike,
If you need John speak up now.
If not, he's gone on Tuesday.
Let Gary Smith know today if you want him.
Thanks. 
Message received.
Okay
I got it, pal. 
Michelle Lokey has 269,000 coming in from WMB as an OBA settlement today or tomorrow into the new account.
I doubt that it is forecasted.
I'll just have her call Tracy. 
Are you there?
Hey TK, how are you doing?
We are having fun.
I plan to be in the office tomorrow.
We need to come home, Lynda is about to break me.
Money wise that is.  
See you later. 
DS and LS
I guess this is OK if you are.
Is this a standard language?
If R. Hannigrif is fine with it, then I will be good.
I will be in the office tomorrow.  
See you then 
DS
Talk to TK but I think these will be fine. 
I think these will be just fine. 
It worked.
Thanks DS
Although our actual content contracts are under control, it looks like we may need to spend $250,000 for infrastructure (Portalbuilder license).
I will investigate further this afternoon to see if there are any alternatives. 
Do you want us to spend the money if the alternative is no content?
Dave
I'm thinking 3 and 4 are not as nice as 5 and 6, but that this would be OK, and preferable to moving to the North Tower and that we should be trying for a longer lease, with breaks we can exercise at our option.
We should be in a good negotiating position.
Thought?
Nepotism Policy - UBS have one and I'm worried about Marcus.
One assistant and one HR associate.
Plus me, Julie Clyatt and a share of corporate charges for payroll, benefits, EEOC (compliance), HRIS, other AA stuff and Corp reporting.
I make this about 15 full time people and probably the equivalent of another 7-10 for these other functions, plus their expenses.
If you want I can try to nail down some names for these people but I'm not sure that makes a whole lot of sense.
They are more efficiently pooled.
David
9 AM update meeting.
I have a 10 AM with Dynegy to discuss bullpen list.
OK
1 - number of questions on this.
Answer is you would get severance and their plan is quite generous (presuming RIF rather than performance reason for separation).
I'll get you details.
2 - no MSA contains a release from Enron to USB and EE's who "are hired" by UBS.
3 - true.
Can talk about 1 more if needed.
Michelle tells me their law firm is drafting changes to agreement as we speak.
Probably won't have anything to tell late tonight.
We sold the UK business to AEP.
We haven't sold the US business as yet.
I will talk with Jim Fallon and lawyers.
But I believe answer will be yes.
This is good I think.
Presumably so do you.
I'll see if we can incorporate some of this in the changes we are proposing.
Maybe stuff we do more of next year.
We had a VP PRC meeting Thursday.
Went well.
I'll send you minutes.
Do you need Mary or I to prepare anything for Monday AM meeting?
I have other things to worry about!
Thanks I will.
I think I'm OK.
Presuming we can afford headcount? 
The objective seems to have gotten a little lost here.
We want the terms to be firm and as specific as the version we had on Friday (although I take point about arbitration and vesting of rest stock - although we have to insert something in here).
Bear in mind Umbrella had agreed to these terms and Mark M and Lance were to run them passed Top Gun.
Presuming they did, seems to me it is reasonable to assume this is what the deal will actually be (Lance also mentioned creditor committee had seen Umbrella's term sheet last week).
The covering memo should be explicit in asking the EE to confirm that if a deal was presented in substantially these terms, they would sign them.
The wording needs to be tight and regardless of its enforceability make above clear.
In other words let's make it look as binding as we can.
If we really can't do above let's say so and we can look at plan b.
John, it may be best we can achieve here is an indicative draft which we talk with top 20 about and tee them up for real thing circa January 10. 
However let's wait and see if we can get one more draft done for Wednesday.
For your information.
Did you set up a contract review session with Patton or any Dynegy folks for this AM?
She called and wants to come over this AM.  
I've been asked to provide a statement to Governor Knowles on Friday morning about Enron's situation and the effect on the Alaska project.
Advice?
Kevin Howard will not be able to accompany us to Phoenix.
He will be available via phone.
Please coordinate with him.
Alaska Highway Pipeline
MOU signed
Press release issued.
Met with Senators in DC.
Met with partners in San Francisco.
Conference call with partners on Tuesday.
Meeting with Alaska Governor Tony Knowles on November 30th.
Developing valuation methodology for ETS interest Sun Devil.
Met with APS: undecided, need to meet with key decision-maker.
Evaluating KMI lease offer on Sonoran project.
Plan to schedule Meetings with DUK, SEM, PGE during first week of December.
John Millar to report.
Danny,
We're planning to go to West Virginia for Christmas.
Depart after work on Friday 21 December and return on Sunday 30 December.
I think those are the right dates.
Let me know if I need to make adjustments.
I can return earlier.
Eric
This is a most unfortunate news release.
Kvisle is not current on our consortium's plans to pitch a 4.5 BCF/D pipeline.
Bound to be some media flack on this.
Any help?
Here's the talking points for ANNGTC.
Kevin,
Do you have any handouts on TW's 2002 business plan?
Steve Harris usually has some good stuff from budget presentations.
Great job, Kevin.
Please send me a copy of the proposal and cover letter.
Was Panda able to adjust their timetable for today's teleconference?
Mixed signals from APS today.
We told them that we were keen to deal but needed commitment.
They are firmly sitting on the fence.
They did encourage us to do a deal with KMI.
I offered to form up a study effort with them since they would be a crucial shipper.
They have to go away and have a think.
Their key decision maker did not show which is not a good sign.
They do have a 500 MW project in development near Las Vegas, which may present an opportunity.
Actions
I need to talk to Tom Carlton, their decision-maker.
Kevin needs to bird dog the folks we met with today.
You should definitely stay engaged with KMI to see if we can do a deal.
Kevin needs to set up meetings with DUK, PGE, SEM during first week of December.
What's your proposal?
We've attached conditions to our commitment that I'd like to preserve.
If you can obtain an unconditional commitment from APS, go for it.
Thanks, Kevin.
Good plan.
Smaller, ad hoc meetings are more appropriate until the marketing agreements are finalized.
OK.
Go ahead and turn the next draft with Pinnacle West, too.  
Dennis M and Hal K will send a fax to Stan this afternoon (3 PM) regarding Enron's interests in NBP.
Might include proposals with respect to Alaska.
I still get 7-8 people every day whining about the "trading vs. marketing thing".
Some of it is ridiculous but some of it could go away if we changed a few things.
Either we call every commercial person a trader or we periodically acknowledge the existence of marketers.
I vote for the latter.
The employee presentation talked about "trading and operations groups", the online materials talked about "trading staff and technology", the UBS spokesperson today in the news article said "625 traders and support people", and said the traders are "talking to customers about getting contracts in place".
Tim's assistant tried to pull rank on my assistant because "we are a trading company now"!
The invites for the credit and legal meetings were called "trader meetings".
The master agreement references the trading business.
NETCO.
In isolation, all of these things are trivial.
Add it all up, we have a problem.
We lost some of our better marketers due to this issue - I don't want to lose more in 6 or 12 months.
This is not a ying-yang issue: I am thrilled about this deal closing, but we need to fix this or else we will have a nonproductive group of expensive personnel.
Just a thought - I think our PR people and outside law firm should stop referring to NetCo as a joint venture - it hurts our ability to get commercial and regulatory agreements in place.
Chris
Just heads - I am sending out a more detailed update to the larger group later today.
I have not seen any numbers nor have I heard from Faith.
I talked to Duran.
Did you mean Oxley?
That's a lot of dollars.
Same camp as Davies, Lagrasta.
Milly is a seller.
I've never worked with her.
What does Hunter think?
Can we go to 150/150 with Foster?
One final New Year's email: the Netco startup plan for power is assuming 45-60 days to get a FERC license, 60-120 days to get transmission and pool agreements, etc. so transaction volumes will be trivial for the first few months unless we look at some new approaches such as buying a small marketer.
Presto, Belden, Sager, Nicholai and I are meeting 9:30 Wednesday to discuss.
Hillis set up a room if you would like to attend.   
I think it is a mistake but if we need to hit a number it is doable - if Amy can provide the support by always having a line of communication open and visiting Portland every few weeks.
I have master counterparty lists from credit, legal and EOL.
Milnthorp and I are getting input from the various desks - we have "national accounts", large regionals and customers.
They are ranked by volume and include type of contract, entity name, credit limits, etc.
There are approximately 50 counterparties that we want to hit in the first week of business.
We will have some good detail by January 7.
Regards,
Just got this.
I'm leaving around noon tomorrow to catch a flight.
How are things?
I think Tim wants to move quickly.
You too!
I saw your 5:30 AM message!
Thanks, having a good time.
Aloha!
Back at you.
Test
Don't forget the wood.
Mike is putting pressure on me.
Good luck.  
Barry, hope that you had a great Christmas.
Just wanted to touch base.
I am continuing to handle some issues from home on KeySpan and some Florida contracts.
I am not scheduled back until January 3.  
Let me know if I can do anything.
Frank
Not a problem.
I think that we got a good deal and you should not be getting dinged for that deal.
Other than the Trigen deal, let me know if there are other deals that are a problem and I will look into them.
I want to get all of that stuff cleaned up.
Happy Thanksgiving.
I am in the Pittsburg airport trying to forget about work.
Hope that you have a great TG.
Louise, I am out on January 2 and returning on the third.
I have received your messages and will respond accordingly.
See you on the third.
Frank 
Bill and Maria, please plan on calling in if at all possible.
Greg
I agree.
Please stay on top of the security issue.
If ENA doesn't provide security, we need to be in a position to step in.
A letter is being sent today.
First objective is to keep electricity flowing.
Bill is doing a great job on this.
I will.
No problem Maria, please contact Rick.
Do we need to meet before the meeting with SoCal?
I will call.
In the European CSFB prepay which was just extended, Morgan Stanley was also involved for a related swap of the same amount.
I think CSFB was aware of that on the euro prepay.
Has it been mentioned yet?
Treasa knows the details.
I wonder if RBS is another institution which could move quickly.
They have capacity now.
Tony, please print and send 12 copies up to 50 ASAP.
I am still hearing rumors about an involuntary by Haynes and Boone.
Has anyone else heard anything?
Don't they have some conflicts here?
Hugh 
Has Dynegy made a specific request?
If so what was it?
I think what you are proposing should be fine but it would help to understand the background.
Board meeting running long. 
This message is about new building tour.
Got your message.
Call me at 832.865.2445.
Thanks
Jeff worked for EES before and came to us highly recommended.
Also know that I won't be talking to Jeff until next week.
I will bring John Brindle.
What does "held" mean?
Do they start over or do they pick up where they left off?
Thank you.
I enjoyed our discussion very much and was very impressed with your accomplishments and experience.
And yes I am learning how to use the Blackberry reasonably well.
I enjoyed our discussion very much.
Thanks so much for the message.
I am hanging in and hanging on, as is everyone else.
I have never seen such courage and strength in an uncertain environment.
Thanks for your offer.
You hang in there too.
Thanks for all you are doing
No, but thanks. 
Please send to Hartsoe for comment.
GP
Thanks, James.
You're the greatest.
Can you call me at home?
713 622 6405
Jim.
Any word?
Joe
How do you like the Blackberry?
Will follow up today.  
Thanks for note.
I can't get online, only blackberry, but got gist of message.
We will not decide till next week as you know.
We are not looking to assign deals but don't like the CPUC reach.
See you next week.
Heard your name on TV last night.
Please forward all necessary data and models per the NetCo agreement.
Are you in today?
If not can I call you?
Does the state have copies of all programs?
Should systems manage the migration?
Muller was going to send Vince the copy of the contract indicating the section to Vince that required the turnover just to make sure we were doing the right thing.
Did that happen?
Lynn, got to the office OK.
Is there anything major going on?
Is Terry pulling his hair out yet?
John
Lynn, are you going to be able to attend the meeting?
I also just received my Blackberry, cool.
JWB
Sherri
I likely will be arriving late, so probably should pass.
Please pass along my thanks, though.
JT
$2.75B and counting.
Chuck's numbers he walked you through earlier assumed 100 BPS in fees so we are slightly better than forecast.
The 65 BPS was computed for the original transaction for which we drafted dox and received ratings from S&P and Moody's.
Had we not run into the El Paso issues the number would have held.
Given that the new structure requires a new market, new rating agency process and new documentation, we are effectively documenting and selling a new second transaction.
An increase in the fee for this substantial change of the deal is market.
I still believe a September 30 closing is unrealistic.
If all goes well, I think we can be done by mid October.
To reach a September 30 closing, I think the only option would be to ask bank of America to underwrite and buy the whole thing.
That would likely be an expensive option.
We can discuss in much more detail at our 9 AM meeting tomorrow.
I'd be hesitant to show panic that we must sell the asset at any price prior to September 30 and trade real economic value and negotiate from a weaker position when we can have a clean sale two weeks later (ideally before 3Q earnings release).
The assets are still warehoused off balance sheet and fortunately El Paso's credit spreads have been trading in to our benefit.
Just my thoughts.
PS: your gift made my day.
I'm fully recovered and back on pace.
Confirmed with Mark Taylor.
Without the language on assignment in the LC, if you move the underlying trades to a permitted affiliate, the LC would not follow.
So the language does have value.
Message is getting through.
Will let you know how Barclays responds on these ERCS, etc.
Also, spoke with Joe Gold and he can be ready to move his $300M quickly through Barclays as well.
Had conference calls with Godfrey, Lamb and Mitchell on Indian Mesa 2. 
I have a quick meeting with legal on interpreting the contract ambiguity regarding curtailment this morning and can fill you in on all those discussions shortly.
BBB+/BBB- issue needs another follow up today and hopefully can be put away.
Also, regarding the cash flow from Canada.
Suspicion is approx 40% is due from ENA to ECC so it might get washed out in the consolidated EA reporting.
Wes's team is comparing ECC's projected financials to what was included for ECC in the current estimate.
Hanover deal done.
$40M in by Tuesday.
$67M within 10 trading days.
I am going to start preparing documents to terminate our involvement with AIG.
Do we need to discuss?
I'm working on a liquidity forecast.
Can you get me an estimate of how much cash margin we are still holding that might get converted to LC's?
On Mahonia margining, I spoke with Mike Garberding.
Tells me he went through all collateral issues on these deals with Wendi Lebrocq in credit last week and everything tied exactly.
He will walk Tanya Rohauer through the exact same steps tomorrow.
Eric Boyt is pulling deal numbers and details to match to documents.
Quick updates: spoke with Larry lawyer at EGM.
Thinks they would take a $30-$40mm P&L hit to liquidate SO2 position.
Barclays returned our calls suggesting they would think about alternatives including rolling deal as is and be back to us by 6 AM.
Per deal, if we don't reach agreement by noon, we have to call credits for payment Wednesday.
Will let you know how call goes in morning.
I understand that while Bowen signed draw requests on Thursday, legal had OK'd.
Today, I understand legal is less comfortable.
I've got a call into Bowen.
If he'll sign no issues with Barclays.
Will give you more shortly.
No sign of Chuck and not responding to messages.
Team is Bradford and Carol St Clair on master netting agreement.
Joel Ephross on issues reacquiring economic interests/swaps from Jedi2/Whitewing.
Lisa Mellencamp on any issues regarding pending litigation.
I'm still running point until I find Ward.
FYI on the demand letter I signed earlier.
Mahonia transaction is one way margin only because Mahonia has already prepaid their leg of the transaction so there is never a scenario where the floating leg would be less than the fixed leg (which has been bought down to 0) so margining is not possible in that direction.
As prices fall we effectively begin to repay the transaction.
We can follow up in more detail later on the structure but we will also work on mitigating the margin required due to falling prices as the pipe deal closes and resources can be redeployed.
Offered 92.5 BPS in fees to Bofa this AM.
They are to execute the mandate letter by close of business today.
Regarding Canada: Rob is predicting $462M Canadian cash balance for year end.
Approximately half is due to organic cash flow.
The rest is a byproduct of slapshot.
I've got a call into Wes to see if these numbers were in the second current estimate or not.
I've talked with Stephen Douglas about getting the cash back early through a repurchase of the preferred shares ECC issued to Corp earlier this year.
I should have more info by our meeting this afternoon.
Once you do, you can never go back.
It will interfere with every dinner, theatre, social event you plan.
But it is quite powerful for communications and managing a group while traveling.
Mostly a social call.
Brief discussion on noise in the market he's hearing and reading, etc.
He walked me through outstanding issues on Alamac that he is working with Duran and Heather to resolve.
Heather tells me there are only two remaining issues so I'll follow up on those.
I suggested rather than buying assets from us (Alamac), he should be ready for us to ask him to co-invest alongside us if we need equity partners in transactions (BNY, Cogentrix, UAE, etc - didn't discuss any particular deals).
Told him we'd expect him to turn the deals quickly.
He's ready and willing to be here any day we have something to discuss with him.
I can fill you in on more details later.
Budget allocation from Glisan has been postponed.
I will let you know the outcome when it's resolved.
I've been in with Kaminski and Bowen all morning so I have limited feedback today.
I heard we had preliminary good feedback from Cadwalader on pledging contracts.
Issue on post bankruptcy price risk issue remains.
Agreed.
Haedicke has given me Travis and Mary Cook as legal and I understand they are digging through the contracts.
I want to verify with litigation that the scope of the lawsuits regarding the El Paso swaps would preclude their inclusion in a master netting agreement.
I'm walking lenders through ENA on/off BS debt and why majority is not, and must not, be considered Enron recourse for sizing additional leverage.
With regards to the existing deal, the setup costs and timeline was primarily the result of working out the kinks on legal/accounting structures to find a deal structure both sides could live with.
I would hope costs would be lower on future additions.
Having said that, though, the underlying inventory items would have to be evaluated by the lenders for residual value and liquidity.
To the degree the underlying asset would support less than book value upon a quick liquidation, the put/call price protection embeds more Enron risk in the financing.
In the current environment, I am less than confident I could sell the unsecured Enron piece shortly.
Jim, can you stay point on this exercise for the ERCS and other items?
No.
I can fill you in later but there is no financeable value to the ERCS.
I'm not close enough right now to the discussion.
There is a meeting/conference call scheduled for tomorrow to go into details on these ERCS and determine how we spin them to the bank.
Barclays will be back tomorrow on whether they can proceed with rolling the existing SO2 credits and at what price.
I will call when I can.
On call with S&P now.
Sorry.
A bit behind on my emails.
Still hustling to find dollars for the quarter end.
I may try to call you a bit later on storage but we did not see that deal.
Storage doesn't fit any of the capital pricing scenarios we have laid out - balance sheet, PRM, or off balance sheet.
I think, given that it's a liquid asset, it should be priced more like PRM activity than pure debt if it is to attract a capital charge.
Spoke with Greg.
He doesn't want to give the trading positions.
That would be a good idea.
The troops just walked in.
Can you try to get Lavo and preview with him how these meetings go?
Tried reaching you earlier.
AIG has agreed capital call not due until Monday.
I still would like to discuss status of the program when you are available.
I'm not familiar with the individual assets (might include gaspart and CEG/RIO) of that structure but the critical asset apparently is a $690mm loan to Enron.
When Enron hit BBB-rating, rawhide was no longer allowed to lend to Enron and called the note due.
There was a rawhide bankers meeting late yesterday to consider Enron's request to delay the call by several weeks.
Neither Bowen, nor myself, know if any decision has been reached by the lenders at this time.
Nothing but good news everyday.
Not sure I mentioned this: Kerrigan's now running non-regulated finance side at TXU in Dallas.
We started talking about possibility of TXU resetting eastern contract and writing us a big check (discount for early pay to be negotiated based on size).
No word yet from legal on rolling El Paso - ECP swaps back into ENA and arguing setoff rights to get our collateral back we are posting El Paso.
Danny, 
I received three letters stating that since I am no longer with Enron I can access and move my savings plan.
These three letters, not one but three is very upsetting right before Christmas.
I was going to call you but I hate to bother your holiday.
I pray this is a huge oversight but yet I received three letters.
I will call Gary and Fran on Wednesday hope that they are in the office and can assist me.
Happy holidays.
Got here early.
Fannin is a mess by the Dome and elsewhere.
I'll call later.
Michael was great this AM.
Ckm
Hi.
I'm planning to drive back today, and will take tomorrow off.
I'll need to come back soon, but I think it is time for me to go.
Thanks for all your support.
It has made a big difference.
Kay
How was lunch?
I had a last minute meeting come up.
I'm on the 6th floor of the new building.
Michael said his day was rotten.
Seemed fine when I picked him up.
Paige is gone.
She has the game tomorrow. 
Ta ta,
I talked to Peggy last night, and we are on for Christmas dinner with them.
Her in laws won't be there, but friends will be.
Mikey is invited also.
Looking for some gift hints from you.
I'm at the doctor's office this AM, but will be in the office later.
Mom
Hi Suz,
Does Dan know about Julia changing groups?
I wasn't going to mention it, but I was wondering if he had heard about it yet.
Hard times.
I hope he is having a fantastic time.
Hi Alice.
I have a favor to ask.
Please see if you can find an 800 number for Lincoln Life Central for filing a life insurance claim.
Can you handle?
Please forward to Andy Edison and Stuart Zisman.
Early to my appointment, so I'm working some.
Could you find Peter Mims number at VE?
We will also need his fax number.
Talk to you later.
Good morning.
I was wondering if I could use some of the frozen veggies to make a casserole?
We are waiting on the cold front.
Very foggy this AM.
Love, Kay.
Hi Bev,
Here's my work email (kay.mann@enron.com).
My home email is kay.mann@worldnet.att.net.
Neil's work email is nmann@erac.com.
Mom's email is rmccall@airmail.net.
That's all the email addresses I can think of now.
See you soon,
Can we meet at 3:30?
Can Mark Ellenberg participate?
Please email me Randy Pais and David Marshall's phone numbers.
You should be getting a fax from Maurice regarding EES LLC opinion.
Please send me an email describing the changes he is requesting.
I'm in a meeting but will check when I get back to my office.
Just bought out Toys R Us.
Nothing for Paige.
I'm waiting until she comes home.
Gracias,
Neil has been asking around.
Can't get anyone at Enron to think that far ahead.
I hate doing this, but I owe it to Michael, since I really want to keep him in private school.
We've already eliminated his speech therapy.
Geez, I sound pathetic.
I received word that the switch deal is off.
Thanks anyway.
Let's wait until Monday.
Michael has his holiday performance.
Thanks for asking.
Very cute.
All the kids were cute.
Works for me.
Jordan is taking Christina Mordant's last job, corporate development.
Dan is convinced that he (Dan) will be laid off, and I'm worn out trying to talk him out of the feeling.
Is Carol going back to swaps?
I'm taking Wednesday off.
It will be very quiet all week.
I may take the opportunity to run some errands.
See you later,
She is taking over Global Finance Legal.
I heard Peter and Travis will be working with her.
I asked what Dan will be doing, but the person I talked to didn't know.
I think this just happened Friday.
I don't know what I will be doing.
I suspect someone will be doing the power stuff.
I do wish I knew.  
I am afraid Dan would worry if he knew about Julia unless she has left him a message.
If I hear anything I will let you know. 
Did you hear Alice quit?
Couldn't risk the uncertainty.
I'm looking forward to the long weekend!
For sure.
I'm big on the Blackberry.
Dominion's lawyer left me a message that they are sticking with the termination.
I will send them a letter telling them that we will be covering.
Mark Ellenberg is off for Passover.
We can discuss options early next week.
I have been in contact with him, and he is familiar with the issues.
The contract is a bit complicated.
I will prepare a contract summary along the lines of what Pete prepared for MCV.
We can work with it either way. 
Still not resolved.
The only change would be the date.
Chris,
All I need is for you to prepare a one sentence description of the set off deal.
I don't think we need to make a big deal of this.
I met with Dave Duran yesterday to get his signature.
He was not aware of what was going on, and he wants to be advised before the money is paid.
There is an article about the legal department.
I thought you were on 6.
Very nice.
I have 30 minutes then.
How completely horrible.
He'll live.
I'll probably page you.
The power is executed, I just need to get the cert signed.
Have a good evening.
It will all be public someday.
I think FMV is probably less than fifty.
Nothing from Mom.
She was going to leave at 8 or 9.
We have beans, plus I will be cooking trash.
Only in Texas.
Could you email me the new sentence on page 2?
Were those the only 2 changes?
OK to make changes, change out original.
What did Mark say?
Please let me know if you learn anything at the floor meeting.
This is all so unreal.
We are all fragile.
You don't need to get it signed, just substitute the new pages.
Yes I like perfume.
Sounds good.
I will tell them.
He can't help himself.
I am almost speechless.
I knew things were bad based on what you said.
Incredible.
Please call Debbie and ask her to fax you a copy of the executed guaranty.
I don't think the stock price is the key piece of the puzzle, as it doesn't impact value of the biz.
It is all about keeping the banks at bay and DYN interested.
Stay tuned for "restructuring plan" (aka layoffs) next week.
Fingers crossed?
I just sent Alice an email asking for help finding a number for Dad's life insurance company.
If she isn't in for some reason, I'll ask for your help.
Thanks for the plant.
That was so sweet.
Thai sounds good.
I'm open, though.
We are all doing reasonably well, I think.
In a couple of weeks.
Nice weather for it.
Just looking to gossip.
Nothing important.
Will you come get me?
Good for you.
Not like you'll get paid for it.
I will be late on day one.
I think I get this everyday now.
Can you help get this cleared up?
Good to know it exists.
Just kidding.
Do we want to contest, if possible?
Ruth,
Could you print theirs and ours for me since I may not make it to my desk before I come over?
Yes
Ben could tell him about Pompano.
You might forward the email to Ben, I think Pompano has a queue spot.
I'm at the doctor's office, should be in later.
Did you read the Chronicle this AM?
Where are you?
I'm on 6.
I wish he would leave Deerfield alone.
Unbelievable.
Call me tonight 7139736325.
How about a call today at 2? 
We are in a loop.
We need a process to deal with this.
All ideas welcome.
Marisa sent the invoices.
I can't open attachments - can you cut and paste?
This will be hard.
Don't forget to pray.
And be patient as there is no timeline.
Love,
Was it a car wreck?
That is so sad.
Hi, how are things there?
We are still in Palacios, having a quiet AM.
Love, 
We have lots of paper stuff.
We are a little light on disposable cups.
We have lots of forks, etc. (went to Sam's).  
Maybe traffic will be light on Thursday. 
The meteor shower was incredible last night.
Kind of like silent fireworks.
Even Michael was impressed.
Love to all, Kay.
I know several who work there.
John Keffer is the one I know best.
We went to Palacios to fish.
It was very nice.
Wonder what next week will bring.
Could you mark up the LLC opinion and fax it to Suzanne Adams at 7136463491?  
I was trying to remember what Bobby said.
Can you remember?
Got your back while you pick up wine.
I have an AM doctor's appointment.
Fine with me if you carry on and give me an assignment.
Otherwise, it would need to be early or after 10.
I will have to check to see who handles the paralegal hiring.
What is up with ENE?
I'm still in FW.
I'm supposed to talk to Ben and Steve today.
Will you and KB be around this afternoon?
How much volume?
I think in this case specific is better.
Also, please check with K Young to see what is in place.
We don't want to look bad to Dyn.
So does this mean Mimi's email is up and running?
As you know, it isn't easy.
I think we are dong OK.
Thanks for checking,
Thank you, dear.
Your kind thoughts are appreciated.
Thanks, Suz.
As you know, this stinks.
Friends help.
Today has been hard for me.
I don't have the distraction of taking care of Mimi.
I am going to go to work tomorrow, but I dread it.
You are welcome in Palacios this weekend, of course.
Chip Schneider makes that call.
Maybe Michael will go to Quil tomorrow.
Poor Jack.
I'm glad she likes her tree.
I know a live plant is risky, but I figured people buy cut trees and stick them in water, so what the heck.
Tied St Jerome 1 to 1.
They played dirty, Michael hung tough.
He played goalie almost the entire game.
Rosco was great.
We are on the road to Palacios.
Just so you know, I'm still in the waiting room.
I don't know that I will be back Monday.
I need to help my Mom get organized on some things. 
Need anything from Target?
Are you going to call?
Thank you for your call.
I'm very sad, a bit angry with the doctors, and tired.
Your voice cheered me up.
Agree
Any Messages?
Are you on the diet with me?
Can you resend me the Doyle email from last week?
Did you find Liz - if you did is she OK?
Do we have New York sorted out?
How's the share price?
What is the name of the website where all of this information resides?
Would you mind doing the following?
Ring Teresa at Jaegar and ask if she can get me another plum top (sleeveless).
Could you check on my appointment at Manos y Mas that I have a standing appointment every two weeks?
9:00 AM every second Saturday with Michelle.
I would like to have a pedicure every 4 weeks at the same time as my manicure.
So I have an appointment every two weeks going forward for manicure and a pedicure every 4 weeks.
The pedicure needs to be with someone else so it's at the same time.
Could you start working on the trip to the UK at Christmas?
I need a chauffeur when we arrive to take us either to King's Cross to get a train or go all the way home.  
Depends on price.
Kelly Ferrari will have the name of a chauffeur company.
I also need the name of some apartments in London to stay in from Jill Whitehead.
Could you try ringing her?
She has a web address.
I am not expecting any of this today, but it's nice to have things to look forward to.
Did we get from Lisa the appropriate internal account opening form from Lisa yet?
I am on a plane, sorry.
Can you get it from the price screen rather than the internet?
Did we get ours back?
It seems silly to have all of us going to Dave as he is the only EES person attending.
Invite Frank, Laura, Tycholiz, Lagrasta, Breslau, Duran, Forster, Calger, and Foster.
Just in case we haven't invited any of them.
Louise
As I am out if you need anything please contact Oxley directly.
There is a God.
Dave 
I thought you needed him to carry two people.
Tammie please forward to Duran.
What's his problem?
I need to postpone our 4PM meeting as I want to go to the Cantor memorial service.
I need to postpone our 4pm meeting as I want to go to the Cantor memorial service.
Just so you know John Arnold asked me this morning about individuals on EOL.
Apparently, John was told that I had a problem with this.
I haven't had a conversation on this since 1999. 
At that time I sidelined the issue as it was complex, bearing in mind everything else that was going on.
I would suggest you and Mark address this together.
I have no idea who told John this as I haven't had a discussion on this issue since 1999.
Did you see Laura's message.?
It reads like she is in.
Currently at the drug test place there are lots of ENE people on the list.
Is she done yet?
Can you ask Wes to bring the proforma too (15 copies)?
Please ask Wes to come over for 9:30 or earlier.
OK I thought it was in Washington state.
Can you get me the Calger letter done?
No surprise there.
Oh oh
Brian is working this.
Are you two talking?
Let me know if it goes any lower.
Did we take the money against this from the NYMEX swap?
Lavo called it, never mind though.
Yup he can do it by phone.
I'll ask, he just came by.
Any interest in chatting about a job at UBS?
How far is that (the airport they usually fly too) from downtown?
It is probably a good idea to go and stay downtown.
I am looking forward to the salad.
Let's stay downtown then.
How are you doing with Sierra Pacific - I really need it?
We need to talk about this month.
Crystal
Are you OK?
We are delayed, got another 30 minutes on the runway.
I hear Tim has huge problems.
I agreed terms with Greg.
Can you get my contract ready for me to sign tomorrow at 2PM?
Get then to ring Greg if necessary - I really want to be able to tell people I've signed.
Long and boring story - at about 12 we got those administrators but there were no numbers in them - zeros.
David and I sent them back - it doesn't change the numbers.  
On my way down.
Where do I go for lunch?
The meeting is to try and get Portland back in line on timings - we clearly should not be in a position to trade physically immediately but within a month.
I am scared by his approach of 120 days for interconnection and 60 for FERC.
They're not having the baby then.
It's still going on - quite boring though.
Cool
Groovy
We need to send read only IDs to all our customers.
Did we plan that?
What are the units?
I want per MMBTU.
On my way back.
Not good really for me as I was finally hoping to get paid this year.
What are you up to with Vince
What happened?
We need a copy of whatever they are looking at.
No to both.
Let's discuss.
If you are awaiting a visa and seconded to UBS - can you trade?
Do we have anyone in Portland?
I can't get attachments - please send text copy.
Stop working weekends again.
See you tomorrow.
OK thanks.
I'll presume it is dead until I hear otherwise.
Where's Jeanie?
Yes still need it - when are you back?
Let's leave it until we get going.
We will need to allocate individual seats early next week.
I'm fine.
Check with Haedicke
Ouch
We need to add the word energy to the 'UBS Warburg' on the top left hand corner of our screen.  
So it reads UBS Warburg Energy.
Sorry I'm losing it.
We are going to hedge / manage our own interest rate risk so we will need infinity so can you please make sure it's (infinity add-ons) is in the document.
And also can you start planning to have infinity up and running on day one?
We will be managing our rates and we need to plan on software.
I'll find someone to do it.
Nightmare.
Greg is not back yet either so we still don't know real numbers.
Still planning it - it might be just worth joining by phone to check the state of play.
I think you need to push Wasaff.
It is no problem.
I hope you went.
Of course not
In Chicago.
I'm fine with that see you Monday.
Will do
No there will be plenty of others.
Any news from Redmond?
Sorry missed this one - David this was done wasn't it?
I am all over it.
I mean make the move to the US.
Unless you really believe that you can pull off Richard's project which sounds huge.
Make the move.
I totally understand but we now have a real problem with regard to the timeline.
Jim please confirm to Vince you are happy.
80 plus percent of all of our trades are with those 50.
We need to give them a defined group for day one.
I had a long meeting with their chief credit officer from London yesterday and he agreed to put someone here from day one capable of making decisions.
I think we have credit working on 77 and we should start compiling the next list.
On the plane, doors closing.
Are you sure - David and Ellie's outbound flight is 17:31.
I haven't asked Hunter - let's discuss in the morning.
If Motley is in we are out of money.
I think you need to pay up for Foster - the lone marketer.
Have you done any deals yet?
Not in the near future.
About time
This is very sensitive.
Please leave it to Brian.
I saw an offer letter to Teresa Staab so if we didn't give it to her it's on the reserve list somewhere.
David - did it go out?
If so Whitt is done?
See you in Enron House when I get back.
I am sure you'll be back working in EEL before me.  
Happy traveling.
That may be the same for BR.
Lisa now has everything.
She may have been told she had people but nobody had started.
I will be checking up with Lisa.
You're right - typo
Has Brian had his contract yet?
Assume for now that we are running identical trading books as it should be easy to cut the ones we do not want. 
Obviously we shouldn't bother with Bridgeline, peoples or anything like that.
Will that work?
OK by me.  
What happened to Savita?
What's your phone number?
Tried to call but couldn't reach you.
I think we do need to discuss contracts for both of them and find the money for them.  
I am assuming from this that you are in - which is great news.
I will forward to Oxley to make him aware that there is something coming.
I called Tom at 8:30 this morning.
I left a message.
Is that enough for this week?
Can we have them until we move?
That would probably be the easiest time to give them up.
Jenny
What is the cost issue?
This is a problem for timing of restart.
Well that's OK if we don't - I have no idea what Stockman's view is and he is back tomorrow.
It's easier to control money if we have the conversations.
Currently at the drug test - there is a long list of people from ENE who have been here today.
All OK
Can you talk to the appropriate commercial people and get them to decide?
No arrangements - he just hasn't had a good year.
On a comparative basis I can't justify more.
In a meeting with your guys now.
How is it going?
TXU is off everyone else OK.
Chase back office and their restart plan updates individually.
Surely we can cover this from within Virgo's team?
I have no idea.
Is it bad?
I think he'll be done at his current offer, do you want to give him more?
I told him he's reporting to you and Milly and he was pleased.
Are you listening or video conferencing into this meeting?
We are off to the UK in a couple of days so we'll come and see you when you get back.
We would really like some UBS signs for the trading floor - can we take the ones you have here?
Did you get this?
What is our gross margin per MMBTU for 2001?
John here is a note from Jane about some things marketing wants to talk about at our meeting.
Thanks Lynn
Thanks, Lynn.
Lynn
FYI. 
Ava, do we need to worry about this?
Ava please print attachment and give to Steve to bring to Omaha for me.
Ava, please put on my calendar.
John, can you give Konni a call?
Ava please print and give to Steve to bring to Omaha.
Mike, are you aware of this?
Also can you make sure Sue and Kent have seen it?
Shelley, I just found out this message did not go.
I am trying again.
Have a great day!
Yes I am coming twice.
I'll see you Thursday October 25.
John this message concerns me.
Did you talk to Ava this morning?
I'll call you in the morning.
November 14 works for me.
Ava please put on my calendar.
Gary I will call you when I get back in the office.
John, thanks for the update.
Sheila please talk to Avashe.
She had your name on the list she pulled so I am confused.
Yes, I am playing.
Would you have John send me a message?
This is fun!
Thursday works better for me.
I would be glad to participate.
Any time Thursday.
Shelly, there will be no one from my group unless I go up to meet with Minnegasco.
Ava, please be sure Tuesday afternoon is blocked for me to spend with the teams.
Not just 1 to 2. 
Thanks Lynn.
Jane, what about this Thursday for lunch?
Are you available?
Thanks, Lynn
John, if the meeting is Monday I have jury duty.
What did you and Ava decide to do?
Ava, please get with TK and let her know if we have some pens she can have.
Fran, yes please update.
John, please send this to Shelly.
Gary, I would be glad to do a presentation for your group.
I am out of town until Friday.
I'll call you to set up a time.
This is the neatest toy I have had.
Much better than carrying a laptop.
Thanks for yours and Donna's efforts to get this before I left.
Ava, please put me on the list.
Ava, LA was Socal meeting.
San Francisco was Interconnect meeting.
Jan, sorry for the inconvenience.
We in the process of making a change.
We will keep you posted.
Let's discuss in the morning.
Shelly, just wanted to update you on a few things.
Steve and I have been asked to work with McGown and Steve Kirk on the SLA settlement.
There is a meeting in Omaha we are attending on Wednesday with Mary Kay and Dave.
There is a marketing issue in relation to NNG procedures on monitoring stranger's gas.
There is a meeting Thursday morning with Dave and Mary Kay.
After that meeting Dari, Mary and I are going to review procedures for any changes. 
I will conference in for Thursday's customer service meeting.
I hate not being there but I think these other meetings are big enough to have presence in Omaha.
The SoCal meeting was very beneficial.
Only one possible variance from what we had previously heard.
There is a possibility SoCal could reduce capacity at ID2.  
Pat and I talked about TW concerns.
I will review with marketing and the team when I get back.
I love my Blackberry, but still getting used to typing on it.
Anxious to hear how the paging worked for you.
Hope your trip to Florida was good.
Also hope you can make sense of this email.
Jeff:
In Kansas City today closing a deal with Missouri Gas.
Hope you had a good weekend.
Was wondering if you and Natalie connected?
Be back tomorrow and maybe we can visit.
Best,
MAG
Forward it in to Steve for approval.
I need to get a PO cut on Friday.
I talked to Hayslette on my way out Thursday night about this so he is anticipating it today and he'll forward it on to Karon to get a PO cut.
Do we need to do anything here? 
I thought it had gone to all of Enron.
Thanks Dan, we'll look after him.
Regards
MRP
Do you and George have a thing going?
Like the ideas, I'll be in tomorrow, let's chat then.
Would you please send runner to get this?
Thanks MHC
Would you like to take Cam?
FYI, would she meet my requirements?
By the way, I met yesterday with an internal candidate who did not have requisite experience.
Michelle
Please revise accordingly.
Michelle 
Can you supplement the answer to the visa question?
Twanda would you please call Joe Dilg and ask him when he will have his analysis of Diomedes' issues completed?
I am getting lots of questions.
M
Not yet.
Sure 
I would say that we should honor the terms of any sale or acquisition agreement with regards to service bridging.
If we agreed to do so, then our records should reflect that service date.
I am not aware of any. 
Great.
That is exactly what I would like you to do.
Lizzette.
Would you mind getting with Diane on the issue of online harassment prevention training?
We have been looking into that form of delivering training.
Diane has info from Littler on its proposed training.
I think that the costs may be high, but I would like your evaluation of the product.
Would you mind taking the lead on this?
Obviously, this is not an issue with huge time sensitivity.
I have been working those.
After I get all info I will probably consolidate and give to Sharon for keeping but I think it makes sense for me to consolidate all info on these employees.
Carol.
I spoke with Lara Robinson this morning.
She indicated that the indemnities in the contribution agreement covered the matters addressed in this draft and that she was told no more indemnities were to be made.
She also wants us to hire everyone who is out on leave immediately instead of having them show up when released.
Even if the person never returns due to a conversion to LTD she wants us to pick up responsibility for those employees.
Seems unusual to me.
Would you please give me a call at your earliest convenience.
My number is 713-218-7155.
In general if a person turns down an offer to go to a divested company, it is considered a voluntary termination/resignation.
We haven't made that decision here though. 
As to solicitation of employees back and forth, it will be a negotiated deal term.
I can't recall if we put any provision on that issue in the bid template or not.
Let me know if you want me to check the latest version.
Fran, the latest on GP closing is November 15 as a target, but the 30th is more likely.
I tried that to no avail.
Perhaps there was a glitch.
How are we handling others in that group?
We must be consistent.
This looks fine with me.
Frankly I would rather have AK across from us than other counsel because I think that they will be cognizant of future potential and probably won't be too obnoxious.
Is Derrick OK with it?
Generally he doesn't like these but I am OK if Teresa wants to let them.
It is not surprising.
I think it is best for her not to work here, as she obviously wasn't happy.
Am I getting a good package?
From whom?
Sounds right. 
I think that we should enforce the agreement.
Did he get a signing bonus?
If so he probably will have to pay back.
He also will have to honor noncompete.
What happened with Brent Price?
This looks fine.
I would suggest adding an acknowledgement at the bottom, where the person accepts the terms and conditions of the assignment letter and also authorizes the company to deduct the amounts described in the letter from final paycheck, vacation pay or other amounts to be paid to employee.
No employment claims for gas or power.
But we should pay them the 4500. 
Valeria.
This looks good.
I would suggest that we tweak the language in the third paragraph to say that we remain willing to provide feedback, instead of saying that we would like to.
Also, the last sentence of that paragraph should ask whether she would like to pursue that option instead of asking about her availability.
Finally, I would delete the paragraph about lawyers.
Can you and Diane please join me Sharon and Kriste at 2 for a status meeting?
Go to 16. 
Rescinding is what you meant to say.
We're using Weil.
Talk to you soon.
If he wants it.
But I would like a waiver, so I think we should consider some sort of payment.
Is this the conference rate?
I think we should consider this request. 
I am working with Mary Joyce on that right now.
Send to me.
What about Jay?
I think that Pam Butler called him.
I'll confirm.
I'm out at a seminar, but Joe Dilg is working on analysis.
I would expect an answer ASAP.
I woke up and couldn't get back to sleep.
Bummer. 
We are working on it but in the grand scheme of things it is kind of a back burner issue.
No offer.
Let him pursue his claims with everyone else.
I'd send this to Sarah and Ryan for their database.
I'll check around I have a good friend who works there.
I didn't read it all but assume it is OK.
FYI, I have heard from some folks that business folks think that too many HR people are gone, so I think they may be OK with numbers.
Dan.
I spoke with GP benefits counsel this morning.
There are several business issues outstanding.
Fran is trying to get with McMahon to get his take on them.
He is at EB where she is doing a Super Saturday. 
I assume the severance question is only going to former employees, but the doctor question goes to both current and former employees.
Let me know if the plan is different.
I thought so.
I'll get with him by phone to confirm.
What a jerk.
Go ahead and notify. 
No obligation to pay. 
That is fine, but I do have to get Cameron today, so let Shanna know.
Mich
I assume that you are working with Terrie James on this.
The answer depends, so we need to be careful about how we answer it.
Sure, why don't you send them over to me (snail mail is fine)?
That would be great.
Although not a bunch of weekend work, this week has more than made up for it!
Both of us are still here.
You of all people know how hard yesterday was for me.
I hope never to have to go through that type of experience again.
I'm out today, so don't wait on me to file.
I'll see what I can find out for you.
I'm still here.
It has been very rough this week.
Thanks for checking with me.
How much?
Get with David Lund. 
We have suspended our neutral reference practice in light of the layoffs yesterday. 
How about 9 in my office on 3825?
Did you add the sections on what we want NewCo to do for the employees?
See you then.
Let's discuss the charges.
Love it!
Still, I'm always up for opera.
We just need a sitter.
Can't use my parents because they'll be at Lisa Bowman's wedding.
Shouldn't be too hard though.
L M
Sarah
Sarah.
Please feel free to call me on my cell at 713-302-5522 or at home at 713-218-7155 if you need to reach me urgently.
It should be Cynthia Barow instead.
I think the benefits information already is in what we sent to Katie Caplan as well.
Let me know how I can help.
Jeff.
I have no documents on this transaction.
Thus have nothing to destroy.
Mary Jean.
Did you get OK from your partners to publish 401K info to public and employees?
PR seems to think that Glen signed off on doing it.
We think it may be payable as a past expense.
Hi there!
I'm waiting for my close up.
Have we assigned employees to NetCo?
I didn't think we had.
In fact I think we were going to move everyone into ENA and have them hired by NetCo after closing.
I am on Blackberry and missed the end of the talking points.
Could you resend?
We are planning to attend, although I am going to a networking happy hour at my old firm.
I have got to get out there, as you can appreciate!
But I hope to see you at Kari's house.
I know Trey and Cam will be there.
I think that is right, but I do not have the data to confirm that.
I have asked Lizzette to look at this for you.
Yep
Great!
I can't find it on my Blackberry.
I can't remember who sent it, and the ones I've reviewed don't have the info.
Why don't you ask Shanna Funkhouser for the details?
Sorry about that!
Are you being a baby?
Have I mentioned how much I love Houston traffic?
Help!
Hey!
I would be worried if my son was walking around in women's shoes!
You probably do that too when no one's around!
Just kidding!
I decided that I am going to stay here!
You'll be OK.
You can talk to Becky!
So should I drive tomorrow?
Or are you going to be tied up with dinner?
Let me know.
Hope everything is going OK at home.
Hey, so should we be nervous about Kori coming back on Monday?
Maybe she will be too preoccupied about whether she has a job or not!
I am on my way to Heaven.
Dallas and I am not coming back!
What do you think about that sir?
I am really not wanting to come back.
We are about to leave Heaven!
I am freaking out!
I take the LSAT Saturday and I have barely studied!
That's another hole in the NY trip.
But at this rate, I think that a vacation to NY and some shopping sounds like a better alternative.
I am starting to get nervous about seeing Kori tomorrow!
I wanted to go drinking with you.
So I'll see you at the airport?
See, it's cold enough for hot chocolate!
Yummy!
So you're ignoring me.
That's not the behavior that I was looking for.
So, I went shopping today and saw lots of things!
I can't wait to get my half of our prize!
So how many times can people ask me if I am going to get let go this holiday?
Ahhh!
Stress!
You better be nice to me when I get back.
You didn't answer me about driving tomorrow.
Are you sure?
Never mind, I already deleted it.
You snooze you lose!
Because there is traffic.
I am walking in now.
Considering what?
More bad Enron news?
Did you not read my first email?
Hush
I already deleted it.
And I can't turn my phone on.
I am trying to drive and email at the same time.
It's not working very well.
And leave my school alone.
I told you silly.
Dallas.
I will be there in 5 minutes.
Try to survive!
Kidding
I'm going to class.
Two days when?
I'm lost!
I compliment you?
Leaving the in-laws.
Wasn't nearly as bad as I thought.
Going home to pack and then headed to Dallas.
Maybe I should just stay there for good.
How are things with you?
I'm trying.
I'm in traffic.
You can call me if you want or else I am going to crash.
832-274-6528.
Just playing with you!
Are you in a good mood?
Wednesday is definitely a hot chocolate day.
They said it was supposed to snow here.
I'm still in Dallas!
I can't wait!
Not even close.
Um, no sir.
What is your issue sir?
Why?
It better not be about me!
What's wrong?
I am on my way.  
You just can't work without me can you?
I told you that you were a trouble maker!
So if we are going on a weekend, why are you telling Robyn?
And how would I be going for work?
You have a lot of holes in your plan.
Are things better for you at home tonight?
I hope so.
Happy Thanksgiving!
I will if I want to.
Probably bad luck.
These are big storms and traffic isn't moving.
How are you?
Walking in
I fear death is making a strong push down the backstretch.
Right now its a pissing match between Watson and the banks.
We are somewhat emasculated bystanders. 
Mitch
It's death or Dynegy, with no clear leader. 
I'm stuck in traffic trying to get back from "ground zero".
I'll meet you at Bill Sperry's office at 12:30.
Mitch 
We are on a plane coming back.
I don't think they formally backed out, but effectively that is what has happened. 
We are sitting in Weil's offices, waiting to negotiate.
Unfortunately we do not know what the deal is.
We are waiting on the higher ups to fill us in on what we are negotiating. 
Unclear whether DYN is in and the total deal is for 750M, or DYN is out and it is a $500M transaction. 
We'll let you know.
Are we ready for this on Monday?
Let's make sure we are ready!
We should talk with someone in IT who is supporting CAPS to make sure they know the potential issues.
Neal, can you help with this?
MO
We are currently working on options to have the roles each of the resources you have identified performed by the resources in the Estate.
However, I do not feel that the accounts for the resources should be disabled.
There are possible situations where we will need to call on them for coverage and assistance in this transition.
I have not heard from anyone yet as to the expected transition time frame.
We are trying to get all issues resolved as quickly as possible.
Please respond if anyone has a different view.
Jeff,
Let us know if you have suggestions on a replacement.
This is the second year in a row Kevin has backed out on interviewing at the last minute.
If we can't find anyone, we'll have to interview fewer people.
The replacement would need to fly to Philadelphia Monday night and would get back late on Tuesday night.
We wanted to maintain a recurring 1.5M and since ad valorem will decrease as a function of depreciation we thought the way to maintain the constant we increase the 650K at the same rate as the depreciation.
I guess we are almost there right?
Rick,
Let's have this meeting today/tonight.
Ray
Tim,
Can you rough out a slide on rating agencies?
I also want to update liquidity with some comments about LCs and refinancing requirements including Rawhide, Bank RC, Marlin and Osprey.
We probably have to discuss trade behavior and margin.
I want to thank everyone involved.
It was a heroic effort on a very difficult and unusual financing.
How did they get onto our floor?
Both
What information, if any, do we owe him?
Please send me an email.
Is Cassandra there today?
Rick
Rick Buy
I just found a sympathy card from Karen Heathman in my briefcase.
Let me know when you get this.
I am getting the feeling that these messages don't get through.
Love, me.
Weather is bad here.
Will be a while.
If anyone asks just say I'm in Dallas and you don't know why.
What a pain.
What is this?
Do you need to be there?
FYI Rick
Did you send out a global message from me?
I have received many replies that the message is undeliverable.
You can reply via email.
I'm in a board meeting sending you an email on my new Skytell pager.
Are you feeling better?
Hope so.
I better go.
Love, Dad.
There is now a meeting at 8PM as well.
Forget dinner.
What a mess.
See you later.
How so?
I have tried my best over the years to improve deal quality to an audience that usually told me that I was irrelevant.
Suggest you get facts before judging anyone.
I am in Washington all week (until Friday) but may be available by phone.
Had a great meeting.
I'm quite interested as I told Lyn.
Thanks for your help in quickly setting this up.
If you have any follow up comments don't hesitate to call.
It went well.
Can you pick me up at 11:09AM Continental flight 659?
Meet at arriving passenger area at lower level.
It's raining here.
Love me.
Thanks good job.
You can explain this to me next week or over the weekend.
Thanks again.
Still waiting on decision.
You haven't seen 120 in some time.
Congrats big time.
Best of luck and stay in touch.
Rick 
Do I want to be represented by someone named Lawless?
I am out of office this week and will be unable to fill out questionnaire.
I have no personal transactions with any Enron entity.
Hopefully this can wait until Monday.
I'm in a meeting until noon.
Did you differ from me?
Thanks 
Sounds good to me.
I'm out of office till Wednesday.
Trip was good I presume?
6:15 and still going but should be done by 6:30.
Hi I'm in the board meeting but it shouldn't last much longer.
I scratched my cornea playing basketball or have a conjunctivitis infection in my eye.
I have a doctor's appointment for 11:00 on Tuesday.              
My home number is 281 359-6258 if you need to reach me.
Shelley, will you have time or interest in attending this informational meeting?
Thank you, Ricki.
Did you get the message to call Mary Kay?
I sent you a message earlier today.
She was leaving Omaha for Houston at 4:00.
Pira thinks power suppliers in California should be worried about getting paid the long term contracts rates.
Producers reacting to price management.
Coal switching to NG and power guys stimulating demand.
Further out - will fax you price target slide.
Hey
The amount of information we get is even worse as Fred usually calls with updates and since you know nothing - we know less.
I will check into your thoughts and get back to you.
Heading to Toronto to see family - my brother is home from Japan.
I will get Georgie to call you.
He is pretty tapped into it all.
What number should he call you on?
Heightened state of awareness down there with the flow of info.
Will call later to explain.
I think afraid of mass exodus.
Speak soon and take care - if I hear anything (other than what is on CNBC!) I will let you know.
Robyn
203 561 9796- cell
Any news?
Anything exciting going on today?
We are proceeding with a great reception so far.
We did 4 meetings yesterday and have 4 more today and one more by phone tomorrow.
Going well here.
Are you two available Thursday AM to review the IT capital for NNG with Dynegy?
Rod Hayslett
Brokerage accounts.
Do you have copies of the agreements?
Both TW and NNG.
Do you know how much capacity is available to sell in the plan for 2002 and is not sold, i.e. how much capacity is not being utilized?
TW of course.
I am staying at the W Hotel.
Telephone 212 253 9119
FAX 212 253 9229
Room 1716
I have my cell phone and my Blackberry so I can get email.
I should be back in the office on Wednesday.
Rod
Hi
I'm sitting in the airport waiting on the plane.
Going to New York tonight and will be home Tuesday night.
Hope you guys are doing fine.
Sure was good talking to you this AM.
Dad
I am in 50M if you need me.
I am leaving the lake.
Use cell for next 40 minutes and then use home if you need me.
Remember blackberry doesn't work so well at home.
I am unavailable for the 1PM meeting.
I like Nick and Everett.
I am up with Stan if you need me.
I need to go to Stan's office.
Apologize to Steve Dowd for me.
I will not make the CIO meeting at 1.
I'm in Stan's office.
I'm on a plane.
If you need me to call tonight leave me an email or phone mail and I will call when I get in.
If you need me I'm in the cafeteria for five minutes.
Is Kathy here?
Kathy,
Please call.
7138536178
Please call. 
36178
Please send Tomy direct reports.
While I am out of the office today please keep Kevin Howard up to speed on what you see and hear.
He is leading the effort in our areas during this time of stress/crisis for me.
Still tied up.
Well I guess from what is taking place that Dynegy has backed out of the deal.
What Enron entity owns the EOTT GP?
What gives?
What happened to the guy with the paper to sign?
Why is there a note showing NNG as a borrower from Enron?
Would you two think about those who helped us so we can attempt to get some award to those who really helped us out here?
They want us to record the amounts loaned, normal loans, as a reduction of equity, if ENE does not currently have the ability to repay from either cash or other assets or credit capability.
They do not want to count the 1.5B or the bank loans since they will simply increase the size of the notes.
They are specifically concerned about the current intercompany notes.
I agree with Morris.
Little value to the pipes.
Can you please review and get back to Tim?
The party at AA is Roger Willard 713 646 6360.
The party at AA is Roger Willard.
713 646 6360 if you feel up to trying to convince him.   
For TW. 
Can you help me here?
This is the crew.
Do we know what we need?
As you can see not everybody is always on board.
Good to know that the FERC cares!
What do you think?
Please handle.
Probably need additional review by someone now, given the current situation.
What will happen to this project?
Alaska?
Please forward to Kevin Howard.
Here is the message.
We will be doing a conference call tomorrow AM at 10:00 our time with JP Morgan. 
877-382-9541 passcode 473270 to answer some of the questions, especially the CERA questions.
Please send to Gary Smith.
Can you help?
Do you know anything?
Jim should call with a phone number so that I don't have to come over there.
Please send me an email to let me know.
We plan on reviewing with Stan on Monday.
Previously he had left it up to Jeff who had said no.
Can you do the Gallup contracts as well?
I plan to work tomorrow some on the data and can hopefully get you something for Friday.
I have some more data coming.
Red Rock capacity is 107,000.
Just send the package to Kevin, we just need backup, not presentations.
You might say that we are lending the money to Enron and therefore are now looking further than NNG and NW.
We will keep trying.
If I leave here I will call your cell so you know how to reach me.
Can you get me detail then on the capital for the 2 years?
Capital for Red Rock between 2001 and 2002.
Probably a Monday meeting of some of our marketing types to work on this one.
It was in a yellow interoffice envelope, real yellow, not the regular manila colored.
Do you still need me to sign something?
Bring whole thing if this is the note agreement with ENE.
I think that is the right answer.
Do you have (or Bob) copies of NNG's debt agreements, current?
Please do.
I'm in 49C1.
I think there are three deals.
Need to watch closely.
GP is general partner in NB.
However you would have to agree that we have some level of control over the GP.
I was answering Janet's comment.
If you need a signature fax it to the hotel.
I'll try.
The issue is that in order to sell the units there is a public disclosure of the units being in rawhide which may have some more issues.
A 13D filing is required.
If we want to sell then we need to file and wait.
OK I'm fine.
Probably will be working.
What is the mood?
Things are OK.
Have a Happy Thanksgiving.
I just told Kathy to send an email to my direct reports.
I will resend to you.
Just make sure you work with Kevin he may need assistance.
Tell everyone to calm down and get their work done.
Then they should go home.
I know it doesn't help much, but I'm not sure what you can tell everyone at this point.
I have a request.
AA has asked if we can repay the notes to the pipes. 
Not actually, but realistically from business unrelated to the pipes.
They may want to discuss with you.
Have you talked to Somerholder?
Moved to the 7th.
I agree with Jim.
FERC has not issued an order yet.
For what reimbursement?
I guess.
I will need to have my memory refreshed.
If the reimbursement doesn't show up then there is no offset and the dollars spent should end up in rate base.
Isn't that about the way it could happen?
Make sure they are current.
Better than most recently.
If you already have forwarded the memo please pass along the warning and ask them not to forward again.
When things get speculative the language always gets scary.
FGT has been bought and sold several times.
Have to be careful that you don't lose historical data for rate purposes.
I would agree.
Don't make it harder than it needs to be.
Explain versus redo.
I meant to try and explain, not to redo.
Only as a last resort should we want to redo.
No, but thank you for offering.
I think I feel better, but I would like some comfort from the lawyer in the crew.
All three.
Need before board meeting.
Reclass both please.
Not at this time.
I think as long as Enron is performing, I'm not sure why there is all of this noise.
I'm here.
She just came.
Tell her to get my expense report done.
It will probably be tomorrow.
We have the data.
Yes I will be back tonight.
Basically yes.
Hole is unlikely, but is a real weak point in any sales discussion.
I have already approved and forwarded.
I had specifically taken this deal to Jeff for approval, and he had decided to not go forward at that point in time.
I would like to get a review with Stan and Jeff to decide.
I will not be able to attend.
Accounting has been able to look in and find that they actually did have a third party.
Check with Vince Strohmeyer.
No
Not even in yet.
Are you sure I don't need to be there?
I am at the lake. 
936 597 3905
Check and find out form?
Is that EOTT or the company that owns it?
Unless you can think of a reason why not it makes it simpler, I think.
Sent to 8
We are also doing a due diligence all day Thursday with Dynegy on NNG.
Don't know
I will likely not be available.  
I think that we are already well underway on TW's red rock and were not expecting to use external capital for.
No other major projects underway that are impacted by Enron's situation.
Next time ask Jim to call me.
Call Bob Butts
Yes I did.
I will submit that that may be the case today.
I am only concerned that when the situation changes that we will not be willing to discuss the opposite and the question still remains as to what the form 2 (regulatory) will require.
I will handle this afternoon.
Not very good.
There will be some better news later today
If we have already signed up and can't get the money back then spread the word that is OK.
If you want us to pursue getting this cash directly to ENE we will be happy to try.
I agree with Morris
Go for the dollars.
I have none.
Make sure you keep Dot and Drew in the loop on this stuff.
I would think that if they pay in advance it should not be a problem,
What is the purpose of this?
Call Luitgard Fischer.
Travis is in charge.
On the other deal, they are back to total capital expenditures and not just expansion dollars.
I will need you to resurrect your language on the gas for Mitch tomorrow.
I haven't heard back from Steve at all.
Do you have a number for him?
That is one of the things we are working on.
At this point in time Dynegy will be responsible for this debt, if they exercise their rights under the preferred stock agreements, which would leave them with common pledged to the lenders.
The price they paid recognized the debt was there, if it is not there, the price will be higher.
Suffice it to say all of these things will be taken care of before it funds.
Not currently under consideration, in fact would be a problem
That was the discussion late last night
Probably need to check with HR group providing services.
I told Gary you could make the call.
OK I asked Gary to have you decide on Michael.
I think he is utility player that can fill several roles, but if your team won't need help, I'm not sure if I need him.
What do you think about Tracy and Jim?
Great job
Yes, plus the ability to grow or to keep the IT PNR and other revenue.
You're welcome.
Just sitting around.
What is the stock price doing?
Has there been any announcements on the Dynegy deal?
I'm about to return to the office to see it.
About 15 minutes.
Love
No, he is in fact commercial doing deals negotiating transactions of significant size, 2.5B this year alone.
Probably can handle Monday PM.
Will get with you Wednesday but feel free to schedule anything after 12:00.
Can you send me an invitation for the two meetings on Monday in Outlook?
I can then accept and get it on my calendar in the office.
Should be fine.
I intend to distribute something this week.
OK with me.   
Agreed!
Can't we identify the impacts of the non NNG stuff in the financials?
There are still some remaining issues to be sorted out.
Not yet
Approved
When do we review with El Paso?
I am trying to get a decision, but I think we need to maintain flexibility, if at all possible.
Still want to try and get it done this year.
Per Stan this AM.
Cash is king for now and we need the pricing to get the rest of the cash.
If it has to be pushed to next year, that works, but if it can be done it needs to be.
Understood
Out of office but have people working on info.
I will approve the posting subject to the condition that it be internal only at this time.
I have forwarded to Kelly.
Stan's office
It's an entity set up to handle NNG's and TW's cash.
Through this account cash flows to corporate.
Joel will handle this.
I will not be available.
Can you bring these to 49C1?
Is there any way to just reduce the expenses for now?
Tracy and Jim are trying to track down six more copies.
Could you see where this stands?
We are in 49C1.
It's fine.
We're on the way.
Where do you want to meet to go over there?
Is it far?
Where do you want to meet to walk over there?
Do you want to eat lunch somewhere before?
I'm on my way back there to do so.
What is in the plan?
Will get back to you.
Get with Dot.
I'm back.
Let's make sure we have all bases covered and telephone tree in place.
I need your home cell or whatever.
Was it an actual downgrade or just that they wouldn't agree not to do so?
No, at least not to my knowledge.
Robert Guthrie
Yes and yes, but it will take me another day or so for the announcement.
Thank you!
There are files that back up the revenue projections that Steve Kleb gave me hard copies of for 2001 and 2002.
Can I get electronic copies of these, they have volumes and margins and appear to back up the revenue projections.
If the same exists for 2000 can we get it as well.
I would like these as soon as possible and you can email to the CC addresses as well.
I realize this is short notice, but if you don't have lunch plans for Tuesday, I'd love it if you could join Kay Mann and me for lunch at Damians.
Hope all is well.
Wishing you both a very nice Christmas!
I understand Houston is to get some very cold weather in the next couple days!
Well that will be very similar to up here in the North Country!
Sheila
Could you make a doctor's appointment for tomorrow for the doctor on level 3?
Please set something up.
Help
We received our INS approval today and will overnight thru notarized version to Ginger Monday.
So it is all in Ginger's hands now.
Shelley
I am out of town on business tonight.
I saw you called but thought it is probably too late to reply.
Yes I would like to attend the conference and would love to get together while you are in town.
I will give you a call tomorrow night when I get back to town.
I didn't hear from Ginger this week.
I did talk to Connie the travel broker and she said that she was just holding our visa stuff pending instructions from Chris Ivins.
Suzanne emailed me that Randi Thompson, the head of Kidsave, is in Kazakstan right now and will be sending out an email to the Kidsave families.
Regards.
Sorry for the unfriendly greeting in the lobby.
I just had my head in the clouds.
Have a great evening!
Did Ginger give you any read on how long to translate our documents or when they might be sent to Kazakhstan?
11:45
I worked on the grade level promotion.
I didn't know what her new title was supposed to be.
Lynn checked with Fran and she told her coordinator.
So I guess we'll have to check back in with Fran.
I consider the no notice to be part of the market imbalance for this analysis.
I can either plant this Saturday or next.
If you guys already mulched last week, then I can manage the planting on my own.
If not, I could use help with mulching the beds before I plant.
Tomorrow is fine
Thanks for your concern.
While it was very scary for Helen, I'm satisfied with Randy's reply.
I forgot to send the address list before we left for Austin.
I'll give it to you tomorrow.
Alina, Chad and I will meet you and Miss B tomorrow at 1:30 at T and C Starbucks.
Then we can go to Zainy Brainy.
How long can you guys shop?
I have some gift certificates for Ann T, Gap and Gymboree.
What is the shower at Patsy's for?
When do you have to be there?
Kim has to travel to Indonesia on business February 8 to February 19.
I didn't understand we were borrowing them.
I thought we already reached an agreement to buy them.
I haven't visited with Stan lately.
Why do you ask?
I know he has a lot going and doesn't have the crystal ball that I and others are looking for.
I'll try to sit down with him next week.
I'm not planning on doing anything this week.
I heard.
I'm just pulling in to the garage and will call back in a minute.
I'll give you my handwritten notes.  
Pre April 1997 was specifically not covered by the 6 month rule.
FYI I saw Ken Caminiti at Animal Kingdom yesterday!
Does Friday at 10 work for you?
I may be in tomorrow too after I make sure Alina won't freak out with the babysitter.
Next week sounds fine for vacation.
I wasn't able to use the global phone in Kazakhstan.
But a friend recently rented one and used in Europe.
The neat thing is that you use you're regular cell number.
Playdate sounds great.
Talk to you tomorrow.
Great
I agree since I am at the bank right now.
Thanks see you at 4.
What a nice note.
I hope you are feeling better.
Tomorrow morning!
I approve.
I have rates and capacity utilization information ready.
I'll call you when I get to the office.
Elizabeth Brown will forward the capacity release data shortly.
The dial in network is down so Elizabeth is headed into the office to get the PGE capacity release report.
It may be an hour.
Sorry for the delay.
OK I'm thru with appointment and am on my way in.
I copied the children's church materials yesterday and will have Gaby drop them off at church tomorrow.
We agreed to have a children's church meeting tacked on to the end of the next children's ministry meeting.
Would you please check to see that VBS is penciled in July 22-26 on the church calendar.
Thank you
Shelley (making good use of my jury duty time)
Thanks for your leadership on this issue.
The commercial staff has been very concerned about the lack of daily data and I haven't made much headway with the GMS folks.
I'm glad you are involved!
I will be traveling out of the country next week.
Others from my staff will attend and I'll catch up when I return.
Happy Holidays
I am going to be available in a few minutes.
I sent it to her.
I will review them on Monday.
No need to send to FL.
GISB group has not met yet.
Lynn and Steve will attend for me.
I'll be in this afternoon and will give you a call
There are a couple of slides in the recent bank package NNG prepared and a few more slides in the original 2002 budget package.
I'm on a vacation day but have to stop by the office later today and will round these up.
Pressure to finish my review!
My husband is in Indonesia on business, so don't be surprised if I reply in the middle of the night when kids are asleep and I can concentrate.
Yes I am here actually.
I'm on a conference call.
I'll email later tonight.
Kim will be out of the country on February 9.
I'm hoping I can bring Alina and make a play date for Chad.
We are headed to Austin tomorrow.
We'll be back Sunday.
Can you meet at T and C on Sunday afternoon.
Chad would like to go to Zainy Brainy and I need to exchange some things at Gymboree.
I already had Donna prepare a revised budget with people assigned directly to pipes and no cross pipe allocations.
It is rough still - but looks like we can stay within budget for each pipe.
Is this cash coming into TW?
Hi Nancy
I have Alina at the doctor for her physical this afternoon, but we should be home by 6 PM and be home all evening.
Sorry I missed choir last night.  
We are still transitioning and Alina had a fit as we were leaving a friend's house to come to choir.  
See you soon
I love you too.
Thanks for the surprise.
Chad thought we were on a treasure hunt.
He especially loved the special kiss.
They both have the sniffles and I have a sore throat.
Man I don't want to get sick again.
Happy Valentine's Day
Oh my, perhaps I've given you the wrong idea about the sophistication of Chad's rock collection.
It consists of rocks he has picked up at the park and a few gems he bought at a museum.
He would love anything about rocks.
She has absolutely everything.
A gift isn't necessary.
I'm working on family pictures for her - so a recent one of you guys would be great.
And, if you want she could use a photo album or scrapbook for her story.
Call me anytime for information.
I'll let you know the next time I'll be in DC and you are always welcome to hop on down to Houston for a weekend.
Tracey is coming next weekend.
We'll be in State College around July 4.
Keep me posted!
Florida is great.
We have been on the go all day and it has been after business hours when I've gotten back to the house so I didn't get to talk to you.
But I have been reading my emails along the way and know about all the meetings next week.
And we can send out an email on our staff meeting on Monday.
Disney was great and I've been to eight baseball games.
Today we're going to an Astros practice and then we catch our flight home.
See you Monday.
I don't know who/what got everything stirred up today.
It is true I have other offers, but none are new.
I've been thinking about them for several weeks and haven't made up my mind.
I'll let you know when I figure it out!
I would like an updated copy of the schedule you brought me with a description from the representatives about why the customer is saying that they haven't paid.
Especially Peoples.
On first glance it looks like many of the items relate to capacity release or Peoples.
If I understand the question, the answer is that we only have to seek approval for corporate changes to TW, the regulated entity.
We would disclose entities above TW in the Corp chain for informational purposes.
FERC is interested for two reasons - to understand that TW operates separately from its marketing affiliate and as part of determining TW's capital structure and return in a rate case.
Looks good.
Thanks I needed that today!
Somewhere convenient to Jim since he has to come from Beltway/EOTT.  
Will he come down Wetheimer?
If so we can meet at Highland Village - Grotto is it?
Or if he comes down I-10N then?
Thanks for your kind words.
I also wanted to thank you for your flexibility in covering both the gas control desks and the measurement desk.
I won't be home until 6.
Have meeting.
Will call when I leave.
Thanks, I will look at it tonight.
Is the system running OK this morning?
No material impact.  
The filing concerns various scheduling and balancing rules.
Any chance of doing the one penny test with the credit departments of the top couple of customers?
I think your outlined measures sound fine.
I would think we could change to the new hotline almost immediately.
We should change all references to say top 10 customers provide 66 percent of revenues.
I changed that in one prior draft.
The other figure is the top 15 contracts.
I think we should stick to customer figures rather than mix customer and contract stats.
Thanks for taking the lead on this.
Okay I'll go for a ticket.
Are you back in town?
Do you want to go to the cafeteria for lunch?
I will be thinking of you.
Rick, I have a number of contracts that the bankers want early tomorrow.
I am assuming Elizabeth will be in to help me?
Yes we need to get it in ASAP.
See you soon!
Got your note.
I'm volunteering at school this afternoon and can't open the attachment on my Blackberry.
I'll review and send you a note over the weekend.
I am getting back early around 4:30.  
We will meet you at 6:30 even if John is late.
We can have wine and catch up.
I am available tomorrow afternoon.
Will 2PM ET work for you?
Will you call me or should I call you?
Skyline refers to added seasonality that NNG proposed to add to its rates.
The rate case settlement represented a compromise approach to shifting more responsibility to the peak.
So no we didn't implement Skyline as proposed and nothing is pending.
I expect that NNG will make a new proposal to reflect peak cost responsibility as part of the next rate case.
Sorry but I'm hostage in meeting in 39c1.  
I'll catch up with you tomorrow.
Sorry to keep you in suspense!
I'd tell her that we have actual tickets for games on March 9 (Astros) and March 13 (Indians), but otherwise just plan to buy the day of the game.
We just pulled schedules from the web.
My feeling is that once they affirmatively decide they are going to Florida, you should say that I rented a house and that you are going to come over and stay with us for a few days.
I know this might push us to the point of her asking whether they can stay with us, but I'm afraid the kids will spill the beans.
Are you going to apply?
What a crazy day.
I'm in the waiting room of the ENT now.
I will make meatloaf for dinner when I get home.
This isn't the language that we agreed on and it will cause serious objections from my camp.
I thought I sent Jim an email over the weekend.  
The language needs to say that Enron has advised that it is willing to treat UBS as an affiliate.
We cannot say the interstate pipelines are agreeing - as this would take agreement of our partners.
Let it rip.
I went to see a doctor.
Shelley Leeds Rickets this AM.
She is a Baylor graduate and is very nice.
Glad you weren't in an accident today.
Have a good trip.
What interview?
I don't plan for us to sign on, we'll just wait for it to hit the board for vote.
Yes please explain that 8 need doctor's signature so she can start preschool Tuesday.
Besides Friday and Monday afternoons I don't have any other planned time off.
How did you make sure it was the right set?
Will it be delivered?
I'm so excited.
This will make my week.
Don't know how that happened.
I'll call you when I get downstairs tomorrow AM.
Fuel is retained in kind from the shippers.   
Please send it to both of us.
Given Gary's presentation on bonus timing I plan to turn in my recommendation today.
Can I meet with you at 4:00?
I am meeting with my direct reports at 1 to work on recommendations.
So I need your spreadsheets ASAP.
Have a great trip.
I'll be thinking of you.
I am getting home early.
We are supposed to land at 3PM.
Love you.
Hope your week is going well.
I'm discouraged to still be sick (asthma or bronchitis or the like).
Also, I'm sure that you have heard the perils of Enron.
Then there is adoption stuff and then there is world news.
I am really hoping that you will have some time to be my therapist this weekend.
What would you think about trying to coordinate hair appointments on Saturday?
My only constraint is Chad's noon soccer game.
If hair doesn't work then how about coffee?
I am out of town on business.
Are you interested in dinner tomorrow night at cafe express?
On Saturday Chad has a 3PM soccer game and a 5:30 birthday party.
We can work around these plans if you prefer.
I would like to discuss.
Please call tomorrow if possible.
I think we should put a number on the table.
Stan
What is wrong?
My Blackberry did not pick up the email you were responding to.
Happy Holidays to you and your staff.
Selling Wessex is the right move for everyone.
I am glad that things are going well.
Let me know if I can be of help.
Please make sure Bob Kelley is on the list.
I'll get you one.
I'm replying real-time, using my Blackberry while in a meeting in California with Pickering.
What period does the max rate assumption cover?
The comment that troubles me more is that we are fully contracted West thru 2005.
That is not true.
Did we send the new version to K/M yet?
I have no way of seeing the slide on my Blackberry.
Do you want to fax it to my hotel?
I can look at it tonight.
No can do.
Tonight is my anniversary.
Jeff
This seems fine to me.
We will get you a copy.
Chris Foster is in!
I forgot one person when we spoke on Friday.
Scotty Gilbert
Eugene Lee
Donna Sheidun
Heather Dunton
Let's take this up when Chris and I are in Houston.
If possible, I'd like to get Amy's opinion.
Tim
I believe that now that we have signed, there is no condition precedent that will allow for the board to say no to the deal.
Given the prior understanding we had that this transaction did not require board approval, I do not think we can or should ask for that approval now.
Thanks, I think we have taken care of this.  
Knock yourself out.
Dash was signed back in October and we determined that board approval was not needed.
Buy and Pug said that non-core assets less than $500 million did not need board approval.
The document has been signed and we do not have an out for our board.  
Dave, 
Please work with the folks to make sure this happens ASAP as they need to have access before Monday due to the UBS cutover.
Tom
Murray,
We may need more logins if there are multiple people required to schedule.
These logins are to allow the UBS schedulers to continue to perform for us after their login is converted to the UBS system.
I would prefer that they have individual logins so we can audit who did what.
Are you getting all the information you need?  
James should be in and I can tell him or Steve where to get schedules.
I will leave my Blackberry on.
Good luck!
Are you going to join us for lunch?
Did you budget to use the company plane in 2002?
Do you think you will need me to come back into the office tonight?
I don't want to let my nanny go home if you think you need me.
Has your 4th quarter changed?
I am here today, I am in Stan's staff meeting.
Please let James and Kathy know.
I will join your call around 1:30 and I will leave around 1:50.
Let me know if I miss anything.
Is it over?
Can you help with this one?
I need you to consolidate into one schedule for TW.
Get with Mary for format.
No problem.
Did you set up my corporate account for me?
My mobile number is 7134080929.
Please transfer the balance from my personal to my corporate.  
Let me know if I can help.
I will be back Friday.
You have a nice holiday too.
I want the payment from the final bill to go to the corporate account as well.
I do not need the bill to go to my home address.
I would like it paid through I Buy It.
Is this because we have not rolled 2001 actuals in and thru 2002 plan?
We are working on this as we speak.
I hope to have before the end of the day.
Can you get with Mary and make sure?
We don't seem to have any positive income there.
Should I bring you something back?
Have you heard from Stan on the O and M?
Did you tell Steve?
I guess that's additive to my stretch?
I don't know if we have the Trailblazer information in house.
Mike McGowan in Omaha would be the only one who might know.
If he does not have it, we will have to call Trailblazer directly.
I don't know how to get in touch with Mike outside of the office.
Can you wait until Monday?
If not, I can try information in Omaha.
I am sorry you had to come in.
Maybe you can leave early.
Have a good weekend.
I like it.
I would like to make sure we know the definition per group.
What is happening to the stock price?
I heard it was at 5?
It's not looking too good is it? 
I am in a due diligence meeting until 6:00.
I can review afterwards and get back to you tonight.
Is that OK?
I was planning to attend.
I will be listening in for a little while.
I might have something at the office.
I can be there within the hour.
Steve Gilbert is working on this.
How soon do you need it?
Working on it
Where are they hitting the books at?
I can get them.
9:30 OK?
On its way
What level of detail do you need?
I have a high level in my office.
Jan has a lot of detail.
Do you need it today?
I can call Jan at home so I can get access.
Is there a meeting with Kevin Howard today on this?
I would like to attend if so.
Hang in there guys.
I'll come have a beer with you guys later.
Let me know where you might be.
I am now officially a Blackberry addict.
DWD
NERCO is waiting.
What's going on?
Where are you DSM boy?
What's up?
EES and EEMC want to have the ability to pay more in advance (i.e., change the terms to allow us to not fall below three days in escrow rather than having to refresh on a daily basis).
I do not want to have to go to the cash committee every day.
I would rather fund seven days in advance each Monday.
If we are not sure we can keep customers week to week why are we even doing this?
I am monitoring email.
It appears that EESI and EPMI were mixed up.
Please confirm.
Also it appears no payment is required tomorrow.
Since this is the first time we received this form I just wanted to confirm.
Wade
