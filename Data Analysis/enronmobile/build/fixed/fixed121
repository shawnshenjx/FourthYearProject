Subject: I need your help
I still get 7-8 people every day whining about the "trading vs. marketing thing".
Some of it is ridiculous but some of it could go away if we changed a few things.
Either we call every commercial person a trader or we periodically acknowledge the existence of marketers.
I vote for the latter.
The employee presentation talked about "trading and operations groups", the online materials talked about "trading staff and technology", the UBS spokesperson today in the news article said "625 traders and support people", and said the traders are "talking to customers about getting contracts in place".
Tim's assistant tried to pull rank on my assistant because "we are a trading company now"!
The invites for the credit and legal meetings were called "trader meetings".
The master agreement references the trading business.
NETCO.
In isolation, all of these things are trivial.
Add it all up, we have a problem.
We lost some of our better marketers due to this issue - I don't want to lose more in 6 or 12 months.
This is not a ying-yang issue: I am thrilled about this deal closing, but we need to fix this or else we will have a nonproductive group of expensive personnel.
