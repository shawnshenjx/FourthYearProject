Hey
The amount of information we get is even worse as Fred usually calls with updates and since you know nothing - we know less.
I will check into your thoughts and get back to you.
Heading to Toronto to see family - my brother is home from Japan.
I will get Georgie to call you.
He is pretty tapped into it all.
What number should he call you on?
Heightened state of awareness down there with the flow of info.
Will call later to explain.
I think afraid of mass exodus.
Speak soon and take care - if I hear anything (other than what is on CNBC!) I will let you know.
