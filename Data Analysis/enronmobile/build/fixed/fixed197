Regarding Canada: Rob is predicting $462M Canadian cash balance for year end.
Approximately half is due to organic cash flow.
The rest is a byproduct of slapshot.
I've got a call into Wes to see if these numbers were in the second current estimate or not.
I've talked with Stephen Douglas about getting the cash back early through a repurchase of the preferred shares ECC issued to Corp earlier this year.
I should have more info by our meeting this afternoon.
