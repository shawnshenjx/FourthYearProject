Subject: Re: Contract
1 - number of questions on this.
Answer is you would get severance and their plan is quite generous (presuming RIF rather than performance reason for separation).
I'll get you details.
2 - no MSA contains a release from Enron to USB and EE's who "are hired" by UBS.
3 - true.
Can talk about 1 more if needed.
