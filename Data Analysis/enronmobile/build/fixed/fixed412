80 plus percent of all of our trades are with those 50.
We need to give them a defined group for day one.
I had a long meeting with their chief credit officer from London yesterday and he agreed to put someone here from day one capable of making decisions.
I think we have credit working on 77 and we should start compiling the next list.
On the plane, doors closing.
