Louise,
I think we should try to sell some of our in the money positions.
Bradford did not want to pursue this when we were doing the ring trades for AEP, but now it seems as though we should do it simply to raise cash.  
I know it is our core business, but it might be quicker than selling Brazil. 
Target customers: Munis, Wapa, BPA.
