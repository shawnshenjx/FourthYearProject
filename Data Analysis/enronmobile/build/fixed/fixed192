Quick updates: spoke with Larry lawyer at EGM.
Thinks they would take a $30-$40mm P&L hit to liquidate SO2 position.
Barclays returned our calls suggesting they would think about alternatives including rolling deal as is and be back to us by 6 AM.
Per deal, if we don't reach agreement by noon, we have to call credits for payment Wednesday.
Will let you know how call goes in morning.
I understand that while Bowen signed draw requests on Thursday, legal had OK'd.
Today, I understand legal is less comfortable.
I've got a call into Bowen.
If he'll sign no issues with Barclays.
Will give you more shortly.
