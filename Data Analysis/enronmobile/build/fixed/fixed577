Subject: Re: Talking Points for Proposed NETCO Employees
Have we assigned employees to NetCo?
I didn't think we had.
In fact I think we were going to move everyone into ENA and have them hired by NetCo after closing.
I am on Blackberry and missed the end of the talking points.
Could you resend?
Thanks.
Michelle
