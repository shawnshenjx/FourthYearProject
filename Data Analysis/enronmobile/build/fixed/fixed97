Subject: Re: FW: PRC Process
This is good I think.
Presumably so do you.
I'll see if we can incorporate some of this in the changes we are proposing.
Maybe stuff we do more of next year.
We had a VP PRC meeting Thursday.
Went well.
I'll send you minutes.
Do you need Mary or I to prepare anything for Monday AM meeting?
David
