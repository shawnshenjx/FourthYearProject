Subject: Re: UBS application
This isn't the language that we agreed on and it will cause serious objections from my camp.
I thought I sent Jim an email over the weekend.  
The language needs to say that Enron has advised that it is willing to treat UBS as an affiliate.
We cannot say the interstate pipelines are agreeing - as this would take agreement of our partners.
