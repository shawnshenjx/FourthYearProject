Yes I am here actually.
I'm on a conference call.
I'll email later tonight.
Kim will be out of the country on February 9.
I'm hoping I can bring Alina and make a play date for Chad.
We are headed to Austin tomorrow.
We'll be back Sunday.
Can you meet at T and C on Sunday afternoon.
Chad would like to go to Zainy Brainy and I need to exchange some things at Gymboree.
