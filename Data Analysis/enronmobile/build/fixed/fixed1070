Subject: RE: EES NEPOOL Financial Guarantee
EES and EEMC want to have the ability to pay more in advance (i.e., change the terms to allow us to not fall below three days in escrow rather than having to refresh on a daily basis).
I do not want to have to go to the cash committee every day.
I would rather fund seven days in advance each Monday.
If we are not sure we can keep customers week to week why are we even doing this?
