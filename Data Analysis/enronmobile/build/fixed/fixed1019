Subject: RE: Parallel login requests
Murray,
We may need more logins if there are multiple people required to schedule.
These logins are to allow the UBS schedulers to continue to perform for us after their login is converted to the UBS system.
I would prefer that they have individual logins so we can audit who did what.
Tom
