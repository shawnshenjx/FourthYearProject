Subject: Re: any good news today?
Nothing but good news everyday.
Not sure I mentioned this: Kerrigan's now running non-regulated finance side at TXU in Dallas.
We started talking about possibility of TXU resetting eastern contract and writing us a big check (discount for early pay to be negotiated based on size).
No word yet from legal on rolling El Paso - ECP swaps back into ENA and arguing setoff rights to get our collateral back we are posting El Paso.
