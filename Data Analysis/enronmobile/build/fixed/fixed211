Subject: Savings plan termination notice
Danny, 
I received three letters stating that since I am no longer with Enron I can access and move my savings plan.
These three letters, not one but three is very upsetting right before Christmas.
I was going to call you but I hate to bother your holiday.
I pray this is a huge oversight but yet I received three letters.
I will call Gary and Fran on Wednesday hope that they are in the office and can assist me.
Happy holidays.
