Subject: RE: Dan
She is taking over Global Finance Legal.
I heard Peter and Travis will be working with her.
I asked what Dan will be doing, but the person I talked to didn't know.
I think this just happened Friday.
I don't know what I will be doing.
I suspect someone will be doing the power stuff.
I do wish I knew.  
I am afraid Dan would worry if he knew about Julia unless she has left him a message.
If I hear anything I will let you know. 
Did you hear Alice quit?
Couldn't risk the uncertainty.
I'm looking forward to the long weekend!
