Subject: Re: Daily Volume Information for NNG Meters
Thanks for your leadership on this issue.
The commercial staff has been very concerned about the lack of daily data and I haven't made much headway with the GMS folks.
I'm glad you are involved!
I will be traveling out of the country next week.
Others from my staff will attend and I'll catch up when I return.
Happy Holidays
Shelley
