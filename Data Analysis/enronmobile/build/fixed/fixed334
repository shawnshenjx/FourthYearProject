Would you mind doing the following?
Ring Teresa at Jaegar and ask if she can get me another plum top (sleeveless).
Could you check on my appointment at Manos y Mas that I have a standing appointment every two weeks?
9:00 AM every second Saturday with Michelle.
I would like to have a pedicure every 4 weeks at the same time as my manicure.
So I have an appointment every two weeks going forward for manicure and a pedicure every 4 weeks.
The pedicure needs to be with someone else so it's at the same time.
Could you start working on the trip to the UK at Christmas?
I need a chauffeur when we arrive to take us either to King's Cross to get a train or go all the way home.  
Depends on price.
Kelly Ferrari will have the name of a chauffeur company.
I also need the name of some apartments in London to stay in from Jill Whitehead.
Could you try ringing her?
She has a web address.
I am not expecting any of this today, but it's nice to have things to look forward to.
Thanks
