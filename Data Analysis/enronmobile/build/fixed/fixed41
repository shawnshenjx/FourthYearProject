Thank you for your prompt reply.
I have taken the time to listen to all of your concerns and have responded below appropriately.
Question 1: my "need" would more appropriately be characterized as a "desire" (something that, according to my Buddhism class yesterday, would be beneficial to give up if I want to achieve true happiness).
The desire, however, is related to the possibility of spending a fair amount of time in diving locations during my honeymoon.
Due to the limited amount of vacation time I am allotted from my employer, I am going to find it necessary to forego all vacation opportunities for the next 10 months (other than this week between Christmas and New Years) and hence find it necessary to use the specified time to obtain the coveted certification.
No, I am not interested in getting certified in Monterey Bay.
Question 2: As far as I know the weather is quite pleasant year round.
I know the place we intend to go is on an island off the eastern coast of
Honduras.
I hope to provide you with a more detailed answer after consulting reliable travel guides and weather almanacs.
Question 3: The diving is supposed to be quite "killer" (as you put it).
I have a direct recommendation from my travel obsessed friend, Jessica, who just got certified there a couple months ago and has provided me with both information and endorsements.
Yes, Belize is supposed to be very good also, but the island we would be going to is practically in Belize.
Please refer to a map of Honduras (which shall be provided at a later date). 
I appreciate your questions and comments and await your reply. 
Sincerely,
Cameron
