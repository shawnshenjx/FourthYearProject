Subject: Re: CSFB Prepay
In the European CSFB prepay which was just extended, Morgan Stanley was also involved for a related swap of the same amount.
I think CSFB was aware of that on the euro prepay.
Has it been mentioned yet?
Treasa knows the details.
I wonder if RBS is another institution which could move quickly.
They have capacity now.
