We are sitting in Weil's offices, waiting to negotiate.
Unfortunately we do not know what the deal is.
We are waiting on the higher ups to fill us in on what we are negotiating. 
Unclear whether DYN is in and the total deal is for 750M, or DYN is out and it is a $500M transaction. 
We'll let you know.
Mitch
