Subject: 
On Mahonia margining, I spoke with Mike Garberding.
Tells me he went through all collateral issues on these deals with Wendi Lebrocq in credit last week and everything tied exactly.
He will walk Tanya Rohauer through the exact same steps tomorrow.
Eric Boyt is pulling deal numbers and details to match to documents.
