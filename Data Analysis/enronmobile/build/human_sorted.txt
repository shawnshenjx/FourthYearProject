Subject: RE: honduras

Thank you for your prompt reply.
I have taken the time to listen to all of your concerns and have responded below appropriately.
Question 1: my "need" would more appropriately be characterized as a "desire" (something that, according to my Buddhism class yesterday, would be beneficial to give up if I want to achieve true happiness).
The desire, however, is related to the possibility of spending a fair amount of time in diving locations during my honeymoon.
Due to the limited amount of vacation time I am allotted from my employer, I am going to find it necessary to forego all vacation opportunities for the next 10 months (other than this week between Christmas and New Years) and hence find it necessary to use the specified time to obtain the coveted certification.
No, I am not interested in getting certified in Monterey Bay.
Question 2: As far as I know the weather is quite pleasant year round.
I know the place we intend to go is on an island off the eastern coast of
Honduras.
I hope to provide you with a more detailed answer after consulting reliable travel guides and weather almanacs.
Question 3: The diving is supposed to be quite "killer" (as you put it).
I have a direct recommendation from my travel obsessed friend, Jessica, who just got certified there a couple months ago and has provided me with both information and endorsements.
Yes, Belize is supposed to be very good also, but the island we would be going to is practically in Belize.
Please refer to a map of Honduras (which shall be provided at a later date). 
I appreciate your questions and comments and await your reply. 
Sincerely,
Cameron

It would be similar to having the BOD of Enron turning down a project with Frevert, Kitchen and Duran support with a signed dash.
Unless the BOD is planning on a new CEO, this is unlikely to happen.

I'll be somewhere between Pueblo and the Royal Gorge, but I'll try to stop and patch in.
I trust that everyone already understands what is contracted and the only concern is our recontracting capability.

The objective seems to have gotten a little lost here.
We want the terms to be firm and as specific as the version we had on Friday (although I take point about arbitration and vesting of rest stock - although we have to insert something in here).
Bear in mind Umbrella had agreed to these terms and Mark M and Lance were to run them passed Top Gun.
Presuming they did, seems to me it is reasonable to assume this is what the deal will actually be (Lance also mentioned creditor committee had seen Umbrella's term sheet last week).
The covering memo should be explicit in asking the EE to confirm that if a deal was presented in substantially these terms, they would sign them.
The wording needs to be tight and regardless of its enforceability make above clear.
In other words let's make it look as binding as we can.
If we really can't do above let's say so and we can look at plan b.
John, it may be best we can achieve here is an indicative draft which we talk with top 20 about and tee them up for real thing circa January 10.

Steve,
Mixed signals from APS today.
We told them that we were keen to deal but needed commitment.
They are firmly sitting on the fence.
They did encourage us to do a deal with KMI.
I offered to form up a study effort with them since they would be a crucial shipper.
They have to go away and have a think.
Their key decision maker did not show which is not a good sign.
They do have a 500 MW project in development near Las Vegas, which may present an opportunity.
Actions
I need to talk to Tom Carlton, their decision-maker.
Kevin needs to bird dog the folks we met with today.
You should definitely stay engaged with KMI to see if we can do a deal.

I still get 7-8 people every day whining about the "trading vs. marketing thing".
Some of it is ridiculous but some of it could go away if we changed a few things.
Either we call every commercial person a trader or we periodically acknowledge the existence of marketers.
I vote for the latter.
The employee presentation talked about "trading and operations groups", the online materials talked about "trading staff and technology", the UBS spokesperson today in the news article said "625 traders and support people", and said the traders are "talking to customers about getting contracts in place".
Tim's assistant tried to pull rank on my assistant because "we are a trading company now"!
The invites for the credit and legal meetings were called "trader meetings".
The master agreement references the trading business.
NETCO.
In isolation, all of these things are trivial.
Add it all up, we have a problem.
We lost some of our better marketers due to this issue - I don't want to lose more in 6 or 12 months.
This is not a ying-yang issue: I am thrilled about this deal closing, but we need to fix this or else we will have a nonproductive group of expensive personnel.

In the European CSFB prepay which was just extended, Morgan Stanley was also involved for a related swap of the same amount.
I think CSFB was aware of that on the euro prepay.
Has it been mentioned yet?

I wonder if RBS is another institution which could move quickly.

Chuck's numbers he walked you through earlier assumed 100 BPS in fees so we are slightly better than forecast.
The 65 BPS was computed for the original transaction for which we drafted dox and received ratings from S&P and Moody's.
Had we not run into the El Paso issues the number would have held.
Given that the new structure requires a new market, new rating agency process and new documentation, we are effectively documenting and selling a new second transaction.
An increase in the fee for this substantial change of the deal is market.
I still believe a September 30 closing is unrealistic.
If all goes well, I think we can be done by mid October.
To reach a September 30 closing, I think the only option would be to ask bank of America to underwrite and buy the whole thing.
That would likely be an expensive option.
We can discuss in much more detail at our 9 AM meeting tomorrow.
I'd be hesitant to show panic that we must sell the asset at any price prior to September 30 and trade real economic value and negotiate from a weaker position when we can have a clean sale two weeks later (ideally before 3Q earnings release).
The assets are still warehoused off balance sheet and fortunately El Paso's credit spreads have been trading in to our benefit.
Just my thoughts.
PS: your gift made my day.
I'm fully recovered and back on pace.

Mahonia transaction is one way margin only because Mahonia has already prepaid their leg of the transaction so there is never a scenario where the floating leg would be less than the fixed leg (which has been bought down to 0) so margining is not possible in that direction.
As prices fall we effectively begin to repay the transaction.
We can follow up in more detail later on the structure but we will also work on mitigating the margin required due to falling prices as the pipe deal closes and resources can be redeployed.

Subject: Re: ERC Financing

With regards to the existing deal, the setup costs and timeline was primarily the result of working out the kinks on legal/accounting structures to find a deal structure both sides could live with.
I would hope costs would be lower on future additions.
Having said that, though, the underlying inventory items would have to be evaluated by the lenders for residual value and liquidity.
To the degree the underlying asset would support less than book value upon a quick liquidation, the put/call price protection embeds more Enron risk in the financing.
In the current environment, I am less than confident I could sell the unsecured Enron piece shortly.
Jim, can you stay point on this exercise for the ERCS and other items?

There is a meeting in Omaha we are attending on Wednesday with Mary Kay and Dave.
There is a marketing issue in relation to NNG procedures on monitoring stranger's gas.
There is a meeting Thursday morning with Dave and Mary Kay.
After that meeting Dari, Mary and I are going to review procedures for any changes. 
I will conference in for Thursday's customer service meeting.
I hate not being there but I think these other meetings are big enough to have presence in Omaha.
The SoCal meeting was very beneficial.
Only one possible variance from what we had previously heard.
There is a possibility SoCal could reduce capacity at ID2.  
Pat and I talked about TW concerns.
I will review with marketing and the team when I get back.
I love my Blackberry, but still getting used to typing on it.
Anxious to hear how the paging worked for you.
Hope your trip to Florida was good.
Also hope you can make sense of this email.
Thanks, Lynn.

I spoke with Lara Robinson this morning.
She indicated that the indemnities in the contribution agreement covered the matters addressed in this draft and that she was told no more indemnities were to be made.
She also wants us to hire everyone who is out on leave immediately instead of having them show up when released.
Even if the person never returns due to a conversion to LTD she wants us to pick up responsibility for those employees.
Seems unusual to me.

In general if a person turns down an offer to go to a divested company, it is considered a voluntary termination/resignation.

Hey
The amount of information we get is even worse as Fred usually calls with updates and since you know nothing - we know less.
I will check into your thoughts and get back to you.
Heading to Toronto to see family - my brother is home from Japan.
I will get Georgie to call you.
He is pretty tapped into it all.
What number should he call you on?
Heightened state of awareness down there with the flow of info.
Will call later to explain.
I think afraid of mass exodus.
Speak soon and take care - if I hear anything (other than what is on CNBC!) I will let you know.

Yes.
They want us to record the amounts loaned, normal loans, as a reduction of equity, if ENE does not currently have the ability to repay from either cash or other assets or credit capability.
They do not want to count the 1.5B or the bank loans since they will simply increase the size of the notes.
They are specifically concerned about the current intercompany notes.

Skyline refers to added seasonality that NNG proposed to add to its rates.
The rate case settlement represented a compromise approach to shifting more responsibility to the peak.
So no we didn't implement Skyline as proposed and nothing is pending.
I expect that NNG will make a new proposal to reflect peak cost responsibility as part of the next rate case.

I believe that now that we have signed, there is no condition precedent that will allow for the board to say no to the deal.
Given the prior understanding we had that this transaction did not require board approval, I do not think we can or should ask for that approval now.

Dash was signed back in October and we determined that board approval was not needed.
Buy and Pug said that non-core assets less than $500 million did not need board approval.
The document has been signed and we do not have an out for our board.

Murray,
We may need more logins if there are multiple people required to schedule.
These logins are to allow the UBS schedulers to continue to perform for us after their login is converted to the UBS system.
I would prefer that they have individual logins so we can audit who did what.
