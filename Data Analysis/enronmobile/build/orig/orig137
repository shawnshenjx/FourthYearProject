80 plus percent of all of our trades are with those 50.  We need to give them a defined group for day 1.

I had a long meeting with their chief credit officer from londonyesterday and he agreed to put someone here froM day 1 capable of making decisions

I think we have credit working on 77 and we should start coMpiling the next list
