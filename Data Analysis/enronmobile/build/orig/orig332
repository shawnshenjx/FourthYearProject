Steve,

Mixed signals from APS today.  We told them that we were keen to deal but needed commitment.  They are firmly sitting on the fence.  They did encourage us to do a deal with KMI.  I offerred to form up a study effort with them since they would be a crucial shipper.  They have to go away and have a think.  Their key decision maker did not show which is not a good sign.  They do have a 500 MW project in development near Las Vegas, which may present an opportunity.

Actions
-I need to talk to Tom Carlton, their decision-maker.
-Kevin needs to bird dog the folks we met with today.
-You should definitely stay engaged with KMI to see if we can do a deal.
-Kevin needs to set up meetings with DUK, PGE, SEM during first week of December.
