Subject: RE: Project Southwood - Revised Contribution Agreement
Carol. I spoke with lara robinson this morning. She indicated that the indemnities in the contribution agmt covered the matters addressed in this draft and that she was told no more indemnities were to be made. She also wants us to hire everyone who is out on leave immediately instead of having them show up when released. Even if the person never returns due to a conversion to LTD she wants us to pick up responsibility for those employees. Seems unusual to me. Would you please give me a call at your earliest convenience. My number is 713-218-7155. Thanks. Michelle
