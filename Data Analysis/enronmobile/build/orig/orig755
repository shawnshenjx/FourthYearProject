Subject: Re: Talking Points for Proposed NETCO Employees
Have we assigned employees to netco?  I didn't think we had. In fact I think we were going to move everyone into ena and have them hired by netco after closing. I am on blackberry and missed the end of the talking points. Could you resend?  Thanks. Michelle
