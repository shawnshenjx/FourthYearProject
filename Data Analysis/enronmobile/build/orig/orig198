Subject: Fw: Real estate issues re: UBSW Energy, LLC in Houston
I'm thinking 3 and 4 are not as nice as 5 and 6, but that this would be OK, and preferable to moving to the North Tower and that we should be trying for a longer lease, with breaks we can exercise at our option. We should be in a good negotiating position.

Thought?
