0 to 5 percent.  It would be similar to having the BOD of Enron turning down a project with frevert, kitchen and duran support with a signed dash.  Unless the BOD is planning on a new CEO, this is unlikely to happen.

As a further indication of their confidence, the deal team is spending 3 days in Vail this week, with family, to reccuperate (sp?).
