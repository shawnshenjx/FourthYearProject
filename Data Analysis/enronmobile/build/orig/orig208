Subject: I need your help

I still get 7-8 people every day whining about the "trading vs marketing th=
ing".  Some of it is ridiculous but some of it could go away if we changed =
a few things.  Either we call every commercial person a trader or we period=
ically acknowledge the existence of marketers. I vote for the latter.  The =
employee presentation talked about "trading and operations groups", the onl=
ine materials talked about "trading staff and technology", the ubs spokespe=
rson today in the news article said "625 traders and support people", and s=
aid the traders are "talking to customers about getting contracts in place"=
.  Tim's assistant tried to pull rank on my assistant because "we are a tra=
ding company now"!! The invites for the credit and legal meetings were call=
ed "trader meetings".  The master agreement references the trading business=
.  NETCO.  In isolation, all of these things are trivial. Add it all up, we=
 have a problem.  We lost some of our better marketers due to this issue - =
I don't want to lose more in 6 or 12 months.

This is not a ying-yang issue:. I am thrilled about this deal closing, but =
we need to fix this or else we will have a nonproductive group of expensive=
 personnel.
