Subject: Re: FW: PRC Process
This is good I think. Presumably so do you. I'll see if we can incorporate some of this in the changes we are proposing. May be stuff we do more of next year.

We had a VP PRC meeting Thurs. Went well. I'll send you minutes.

Do you need Mary or I to prepare anything for Monday am meeting?

David
