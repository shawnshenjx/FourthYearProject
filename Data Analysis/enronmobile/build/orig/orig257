Subject: RE: PPA Processing
Pre April 1997 was specifically not covered by the 6 month rule. -- but 8 don't think that means that we are automatically required to process all old ppas.  I think we should plan to manually handle any pre 1997 ppas that we feel bound to accept.

FYI I saw Ken Caminiti at Animal Kingdom yesterday!
