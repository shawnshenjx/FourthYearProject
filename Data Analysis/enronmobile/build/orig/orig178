Subject: Re: NETCO
One final new year's email: the netco startup plan for power is assuming 45-60 days to get a FERC license, 60-120 days to get transmission and pool agreements, etc so transaction volumes will be trivial for the first few months unless we look at some new approaches such as buying a small marketer.  Presto, belden, sager, nicholai and I are meeting 9:30 wednesday to discuss.  Hillis set up a room if you would like to attend.
