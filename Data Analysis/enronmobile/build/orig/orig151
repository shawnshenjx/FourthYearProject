Subject: RE: So Percopo
Mostly a social call. Brief discussion on noise in the market he's hearing and reading, etc. He walked me through oustanding issues on alamac that he is working with duran and heather to resolve. Heather tells me there are only two remaining issues so I'll followup on those. I suggested rather than buying assets from us (alamac), he should be ready for us to ask him to co-invest alongside us if we need equity partners in transactions (bny, cogentrix, uae, etc - didn't discuss any particular deals). Told him we'd expect him to turn the deals quickly. He's ready and willing to be here any day we have something to discuss with him. I can fill you in on more details later. Budget allocation from glisan has been postponed. I will let you know the outcome when its resolved.
