Yes.
They want us to record the amounts loaned, normal loans, as a reduction of equity, if ENE does not currently have the ability to repay from either cash or other assets or credit capability.
They do not want to count the 1.5B or the bank loans since they will simply increase the size of the notes.

Subject: Re: What's in Rawhide - URGENT

I'm not familiar with the individual assets (might include gaspart and CEG/RIO) of that structure but the critical asset apparently is a $690mm loan to Enron.
When Enron hit BBB-rating, rawhide was no longer allowed to lend to Enron and called the note due.
There was a rawhide bankers meeting late yesterday to consider Enron's request to delay the call by several weeks.
Neither Bowen, nor myself, know if any decision has been reached by the lenders at this time.

Storage doesn't fit any of the capital pricing scenarios we have laid out - balance sheet, PRM, or off balance sheet.
I think, given that it's a liquid asset, it should be priced more like PRM activity than pure debt if it is to attract a capital charge.

Steve,
Mixed signals from APS today.
We told them that we were keen to deal but needed commitment.
They are firmly sitting on the fence.
They did encourage us to do a deal with KMI.
I offered to form up a study effort with them since they would be a crucial shipper.
They have to go away and have a think.
Their key decision maker did not show which is not a good sign.
They do have a 500 MW project in development near Las Vegas, which may present an opportunity.

I need to talk to Tom Carlton, their decision-maker.
Kevin needs to bird dog the folks we met with today.
You should definitely stay engaged with KMI to see if we can do a deal.

Subject: I need your help

I still get 7-8 people every day whining about the "trading vs. marketing thing".
Some of it is ridiculous but some of it could go away if we changed a few things.
Either we call every commercial person a trader or we periodically acknowledge the existence of marketers.
I vote for the latter.
The employee presentation talked about "trading and operations groups", the online materials talked about "trading staff and technology", the UBS spokesperson today in the news article said "625 traders and support people", and said the traders are "talking to customers about getting contracts in place".
Tim's assistant tried to pull rank on my assistant because "we are a trading company now"!
The invites for the credit and legal meetings were called "trader meetings".
The master agreement references the trading business.
NETCO.
In isolation, all of these things are trivial.
Add it all up, we have a problem.
We lost some of our better marketers due to this issue - I don't want to lose more in 6 or 12 months.
This is not a ying-yang issue: I am thrilled about this deal closing, but we need to fix this or else we will have a nonproductive group of expensive personnel.

Subject: RE: honduras

Thank you for your prompt reply.
I have taken the time to listen to all of your concerns and have responded below appropriately.
Question 1: my "need" would more appropriately be characterized as a "desire" (something that, according to my Buddhism class yesterday, would be beneficial to give up if I want to achieve true happiness).
The desire, however, is related to the possibility of spending a fair amount of time in diving locations during my honeymoon.
Due to the limited amount of vacation time I am allotted from my employer, I am going to find it necessary to forego all vacation opportunities for the next 10 months (other than this week between Christmas and New Years) and hence find it necessary to use the specified time to obtain the coveted certification.
No, I am not interested in getting certified in Monterey Bay.
Question 2: As far as I know the weather is quite pleasant year round.
I know the place we intend to go is on an island off the eastern coast of
Honduras.
I hope to provide you with a more detailed answer after consulting reliable travel guides and weather almanacs.
Question 3: The diving is supposed to be quite "killer" (as you put it).
I have a direct recommendation from my travel obsessed friend, Jessica, who just got certified there a couple months ago and has provided me with both information and endorsements.
Yes, Belize is supposed to be very good also, but the island we would be going to is practically in Belize.
Please refer to a map of Honduras (which shall be provided at a later date). 
I appreciate your questions and comments and await your reply. 
Sincerely,
Cameron

Subject: Re:

The objective seems to have gotten a little lost here.
We want the terms to be firm and as specific as the version we had on Friday (although I take point about arbitration and vesting of rest stock - although we have to insert something in here).
Bear in mind Umbrella had agreed to these terms and Mark M and Lance were to run them passed Top Gun.
Presuming they did, seems to me it is reasonable to assume this is what the deal will actually be (Lance also mentioned creditor committee had seen Umbrella's term sheet last week).
The covering memo should be explicit in asking the EE to confirm that if a deal was presented in substantially these terms, they would sign them.
The wording needs to be tight and regardless of its enforceability make above clear.
In other words let's make it look as binding as we can.
If we really can't do above let's say so and we can look at plan b.
John, it may be best we can achieve here is an indicative draft which we talk with top 20 about and tee them up for real thing circa January 10. 
However let's wait and see if we can get one more draft done for Wednesday.

At this point in time Dynegy will be responsible for this debt, if they exercise their rights under the preferred stock agreements, which would leave them with common pledged to the lenders.

80 plus percent of all of our trades are with those 50.
We need to give them a defined group for day one.
I had a long meeting with their chief credit officer from London yesterday and he agreed to put someone here from day one capable of making decisions.
I think we have credit working on 77 and we should start compiling the next list.
On the plane, doors closing.

If I understand the question, the answer is that we only have to seek approval for corporate changes to TW, the regulated entity.
We would disclose entities above TW in the Corp chain for informational purposes.
FERC is interested for two reasons - to understand that TW operates separately from its marketing affiliate and as part of determining TW's capital structure and return in a rate case.

FYI.
I am still uncomfortable doing anything with NNG's swaps until someone can tell me who the swaps are with, who the confirms are with, what underlying contracts are being terminated, and what are the ramifications of the termination.
Until we can answer these questions, we cannot terminate anything.

Jordan is taking Christina Mordant's last job, corporate development.

Is Carol going back to swaps?
I'm taking Wednesday off.
It will be very quiet all week.
I may take the opportunity to run some errands.

I'd tell her that we have actual tickets for games on March 9 (Astros) and March 13 (Indians), but otherwise just plan to buy the day of the game.
We just pulled schedules from the web.
My feeling is that once they affirmatively decide they are going to Florida, you should say that I rented a house and that you are going to come over and stay with us for a few days.
I know this might push us to the point of her asking whether they can stay with us, but I'm afraid the kids will spill the beans.

Every day there is something new, different, and bad about us.
Now, the rumor in Houston is that we are filing Chapter 11 on Monday.
