mobile1	thanks i will look at it tonight 
mobile2	she also wants us to hire everyone who is out on leave immediately instead of having them show up when released 
mobile3	on its way
mobile4	joe
mobile5	i fear death is making a strong push down the backstretch 
mobile6	i've got a call into wes to see if these numbers were in the second current estimate or not 
mobile7	this will be hard 
mobile8	hopefully it cheered you up a bit 
mobile9	we are working on this as we speak

mobile29	j. robert collins
mobile30	evaluating k. m. i. lease offer on sonoran project 
mobile31	early to my appointment so i'm working some 
mobile32	okay to make changes change out original 
mobile33	that would probably be the easiest time to give them up 
mobile34	murray 
mobile35	i heard it was at five 
mobile36	love 
mobile37	i have no idea who told john this as i haven't had a discussion on this issue since nineteen ninety nine

mobile42	f. y. i. would she meet my requirements 
mobile43	other than the trigen deal let me know if there are other deals that are a problem and i will look into them 
mobile44	agreed 
mobile45	davis had not yet updated the model for this 
mobile46	i'm thinking three and four are not as nice as five and six but that this would be okay and preferable to moving to the north tower and that we should be trying for a longer lease with breaks we can exercise at our option 
mobile47	yes i am coming twice 
mobile48	somewhere convenient to jim since he has to come from beltway e. o. t. t. 
mobile49	g. p.
mobile50	sorry i'm losing it 
mobile51	f. y. i. i have heard from some folks that business folks think that too many h. r. people are gone so i think they may be okay with numbers 
mobile52	if not he's gone on tuesday 
mobile53	if r. hannigrif is fine with it then i will be good 
mobile54	thank you dear

mobile60	let me know if i can do anything 
mobile61	no but thank you for offering 
mobile62	thank you 
mobile63	why is there a note showing n. n. g. as a borrower from enron 
mobile64	fuel is retained in kind from the shippers 
mobile65	i'm in traffic 
mobile66	per deal if we don't reach agreement by noon we have to call credits for payment wednesday 
mobile67	approved
mobile68	if so he probably will have to pay back 
mobile69	he can't help himself 
mobile70	i am only concerned that when the situation changes that we will not be willing to discuss the opposite and the question still remains as to what the form two regulatory will require 
mobile71	i'll let you know the next time i'll be in d. c. and you are always welcome to hop on down to houston for a weekend 
mobile72	i haven't heard back from steve at all

mobile95	thanks for the quick turnaround 
mobile96	i think it is a mistake but if we need to hit a number it is doable if amy can provide the support by always having a line of communication open and visiting portland every few weeks 
mobile97	have a good weekend 
mobile98	ava please print and give to steve to bring to omaha 
mobile99	i can then accept and get it on my calendar in the office

mobile111	not just one to two 
mobile112	here's the talking points for a. n. n. g. t. c. 
mobile113	c. k. m.
mobile114	the only change would be the date

mobile117	i'll confirm 
mobile118	the filing concerns various scheduling and balancing rules 
mobile119	you'll be okay

mobile130	yes i am playing 
mobile131	can you call me at home 
mobile132	f. y. i. rick
mobile133	you can call me if you want or else i am going to crash 
mobile134	mostly a social call 
mobile135	we will sign tomorrow and fund tuesday 
mobile136	after i get all info i will probably consolidate and give to sharon for keeping but i think it makes sense for me to consolidate all info on these employees 
mobile137	i'm still in f. w. 
mobile138	can you rough out a slide on rating agencies 
mobile139	please call tomorrow if possible 
mobile140	we are all fragile 
mobile141	depends on price 
mobile142	please forward all necessary data and models per the netco agreement 
mobile143	we are waiting on the higher ups to fill us in on what we are negotiating 
mobile144	it will probably be tomorrow 
mobile145	pretty impressive win 
mobile146	is stan looking for a go no go decision 
mobile147	we are delayed got another thirty minutes on the runway 
mobile148	i would like to attend if so 
mobile149	it better not be about me 
mobile150	the party at double a. is roger willard seven one three six four six six three six zero 
mobile151	on first glance it looks like many of the items relate to capacity release or peoples 
mobile152	he played goalie almost the entire game 
mobile153	we do need to discuss e. c. p. debt today if you're available 
mobile154	did you read the chronicle this a. m. 
mobile155	i can return earlier 
mobile156	i am trying again 
mobile157	i am in fifty m. if you need me 
mobile158	if you want us to pursue getting this cash directly to e. n. e. we will be happy to try 
mobile159	if the same exists for two thousand can we get it as well 
mobile160	i am on my way to heaven 
mobile161	would you mind taking the lead on this 
mobile162	i'll see you thursday october twenty fifth 
mobile163	shelley will you have time or interest in attending this informational meeting 
mobile164	f. y. i.
mobile165	i have taken the time to listen to all of your concerns and have responded below appropriately 
mobile166	do you want us to spend the money if the alternative is no content 
mobile167	what does held mean 
mobile168	my feeling is that once they affirmatively decide they are going to florida you should say that i rented a house and that you are going to come over and stay with us for a few days 
mobile169	i think that the costs may be high but i would like your evaluation of the product 
mobile170	we agreed to have a children's church meeting tacked on to the end of the next children's ministry meeting 
mobile171	obviously this is not an issue with huge time sensitivity 
mobile172	m. o.
mobile173	probably can handle monday p. m. 
mobile174	i will bring john brindle 
mobile175	so i went shopping today and saw lots of things 
mobile176	nine three six five nine seven three nine zero five
mobile177	for sure 
mobile178	need you or john to step out 
mobile179	we probably have to discuss trade behavior and margin 
mobile180	we will meet you at six thirty even if john is late 
mobile181	also spoke with joe gold and he can be ready to move his three hundred million dollars quickly through barclays as well 
mobile182	chad thought we were on a treasure hunt 
mobile183	i thought i sent jim an email over the weekend 
mobile184	can't get anyone at enron to think that far ahead 
mobile185	but i have been reading my emails along the way and know about all the meetings next week 
mobile186	offered ninety two point five b. p. s. in fees to bofa this a. m. 
mobile187	you can explain this to me next week or over the weekend 
mobile188	kevin needs to set up meetings with d. u. k. p. g. e. s. e. m. during first week of december 
mobile189	i did talk to connie the travel broker and she said that she was just holding our visa stuff pending instructions from chris ivins 
mobile190	by the way i met yesterday with an internal candidate who did not have requisite experience 
mobile191	when dan mentions m. l. p. is he referring to using border or setting up a new one 
mobile192	friends help 
mobile193	he would love anything about rocks 
mobile194	i totally understand but we now have a real problem with regard to the timeline 
mobile195	the sixty five b. p. s. was computed for the original transaction for which we drafted dox and received ratings from s. and p. and moody's 
mobile196	rod 
mobile197	of course not
mobile198	what do you hear 
mobile199	i have received many replies that the message is undeliverable 
mobile200	i asked what dan will be doing but the person i talked to didn't know 
mobile201	thanks i needed that today 
mobile202	i will review them on monday 
mobile203	maybe i should just stay there for good 
mobile204	i think the benefits information already is in what we sent to katie caplan as well

mobile240	be back tomorrow and maybe we can visit

mobile244	stan's office
mobile245	neal can you help with this 
mobile246	haedicke has given me travis and mary cook as legal and i understand they are digging through the contracts 
mobile247	well that's okay if we don't i have no idea what stockman's view is and he is back tomorrow 
mobile248	will let you know how barclays responds on these e. r. c. s. etcetera 
mobile249	christie 
mobile250	call luitgard fischer 
mobile251	we should talk with someone in i. t. who is supporting caps to make sure they know the potential issues 
mobile252	they want us to record the amounts loaned normal loans as a reduction of equity if e. n. e. does not currently have the ability to repay from either cash or other assets or credit capability 
mobile253	best of luck and stay in touch 
mobile254	rick buy
mobile255	john thanks for the update

mobile259	until we can answer these questions we cannot terminate anything 
mobile260	i was answering janet's comment 
mobile261	could you start working on the trip to the u. k. at christmas 
mobile262	so should i drive tomorrow 
mobile263	ouch
mobile264	how would you explain the difference between the two

mobile266	is kathy here 
mobile267	do you think you will need me to come back into the office tonight 
mobile268	scotty gilbert
mobile269	if so send me an email and i will come up before i leave for the hanger 
mobile270	i have a favor to ask 
mobile271	get with dot 
mobile272	if i understand the question the answer is that we only have to seek approval for corporate changes to t. w. the regulated entity 
mobile273	question three the diving is supposed to be quite killer as you put it 
mobile274	i'm still in dallas 
mobile275	thanks 
mobile276	we are on the road to palacios 
mobile277	we told them that we were keen to deal but needed commitment 
mobile278	i'm in the waiting room of the e. n. t. now 
mobile279	probably need to check with h. r. group providing services 
mobile280	check with haedicke
mobile281	it reads like she is in 
mobile282	oh my perhaps i've given you the wrong idea about the sophistication of chad's rock collection 
mobile283	is cassandra there today 
mobile284	let us know if you have suggestions on a replacement 
mobile285	d. s. and l. s. 
mobile286	heather tells me there are only two remaining issues so i'll follow up on those 
mobile287	i like nick and everett 
mobile288	shouldn't be too hard though 
mobile289	i saw an offer letter to teresa staab so if we didn't give it to her it's on the reserve list somewhere 
mobile290	in a couple of weeks 
mobile291	has dynegy made a specific request 
mobile292	i am walking in now 
mobile293	bill
mobile294	they have capacity now 
mobile295	sounds good 
mobile296	i am here today i am in stan's staff meeting 
mobile297	unfortunately we do not know what the deal is 
mobile298	is this cash coming into t. w. 
mobile299	will he come down wetheimer 
mobile300	i will call in twenty to thirty minutes 
mobile301	with regards to the existing deal the setup costs and timeline was primarily the result of working out the kinks on legal accounting structures to find a deal structure both sides could live with 
mobile302	did you add the sections on what we want newco to do for the employees 
mobile303	happy thanksgiving 
mobile304	i'm replying real time using my blackberry while in a meeting in california with pickering 
mobile305	we are still transitioning and alina had a fit as we were leaving a friend's house to come to choir 
mobile306	if the reimbursement doesn't show up then there is no offset and the dollars spent should end up in rate base 
mobile307	especially peoples 
mobile308	i'm fine 
mobile309	she had your name on the list she pulled so i am confused 
mobile310	a gift isn't necessary 
mobile311	we are planning to attend although i am going to a networking happy hour at my old firm 
mobile312	it is all about keeping the banks at bay and d. y. n. interested 
mobile313	tell her to get my expense report done 
mobile314	i am out of town on business tonight 
mobile315	unclear whether d. y. n. is in and the total deal is for seven hundred fifty million or d. y. n. is out and it is a five hundred million dollars transaction 
mobile316	currently at the drug test there is a long list of people from e. n. e. who have been here today 
mobile317	agree
mobile318	we need a process to deal with this 
mobile319	i'm waiting until she comes home 
mobile320	not even close 
mobile321	i have an a. m. doctor's appointment 
mobile322	see you next week 
mobile323	this is the neatest toy i have had 
mobile324	it was in a yellow interoffice envelope real yellow not the regular manila colored 
mobile325	see you later 
mobile326	i offered to form up a study effort with them since they would be a crucial shipper 
mobile327	in the european c. s. f. b. prepay which was just extended morgan stanley was also involved for a related swap of the same amount 
mobile328	i heard we had preliminary good feedback from cadwalader on pledging contracts 
mobile329	chris foster is in 
mobile330	i have none 
mobile331	and we can send out an email on our staff meeting on monday 
mobile332	i've been thinking about them for several weeks and haven't made up my mind 
mobile333	no but thanks 
mobile334	they are more efficiently pooled 
mobile335	this isn't the language that we agreed on and it will cause serious objections from my camp 
mobile336	i will send them a letter telling them that we will be covering 
mobile337	i have other things to worry about 
mobile338	we'll be in state college around july fourth 
mobile339	dan is convinced that he dan will be laid off and i'm worn out trying to talk him out of the feeling 
mobile340	hole is unlikely but is a real weak point in any sales discussion 
mobile341	i may take the opportunity to run some errands 
mobile342	this is a problem for timing of restart 
mobile343	i will call you monday morning to discuss 
mobile344	let's discuss in the morning 
mobile345	mich
mobile346	thanks for yours and donna's efforts to get this before i left 
mobile347	i should be back in the office on wednesday 
mobile348	i guess 
mobile349	same camp as davies lagrasta 
mobile350	sarah
mobile351	from whom 
mobile352	i didn't understand we were borrowing them 
mobile353	please call 
mobile354	if he does not have it we will have to call trailblazer directly 
mobile355	as a further indication of their confidence the deal team is spending three days in vail this week with family to recuperate 
mobile356	in general if a person turns down an offer to go to a divested company it is considered a voluntary termination resignation 
mobile357	michelle tells me their law firm is drafting changes to agreement as we speak 
mobile358	just send the package to kevin we just need backup not presentations 
mobile359	rod 
mobile360	i am in washington all week until friday but may be available by phone 
mobile361	can we go to one hundred fifty one hundred fifty with foster 
mobile362	i think tim wants to move quickly 
mobile363	if motley is in we are out of money 
mobile364	that's another hole in the n. y. trip 
mobile365	i'm on a vacation day but have to stop by the office later today and will round these up 
mobile366	please let james and kathy know 
mobile367	i want to thank everyone involved 
mobile368	please feel free to call me on my cell at seven one three three zero two five five two two or at home at seven one three two one eight seven one five five if you need to reach me urgently 
mobile369	having said that though the underlying inventory items would have to be evaluated by the lenders for residual value and liquidity 
mobile370	what period does the max rate assumption cover 
mobile371	chris
mobile372	rod
mobile373	never mind 
mobile374	there is a meeting in omaha we are attending on wednesday with mary kay and dave 
mobile375	probably bad luck 
mobile376	i'm open though 
mobile377	i think you need to pay up for foster the lone marketer 
mobile378	happy traveling 
mobile379	forward it in to steve for approval 
mobile380	still views that mark is out greg is temporary and stan is here for the company for better or worse 
mobile381	let me know if the plan is different 
mobile382	the price they paid recognized the debt was there if it is not there the price will be higher 
mobile383	should be fine 
mobile384	see you then 
mobile385	producers reacting to price management 
mobile386	please see if you can find an eight hundred number for lincoln life central for filing a life insurance claim 
mobile387	okay
mobile388	kevin 
mobile389	dave 
mobile390	i will be listening in for a little while 
mobile391	it has been very rough this week 
mobile392	i'll sign it in counterpart then i'll find a fax somewhere and fax it back to you 
mobile393	surely we can cover this from within virgo's team 
mobile394	leaving the in laws 
mobile395	just wanted to touch base 
mobile396	not like you'll get paid for it 
mobile397	i am getting home early 
mobile398	i would suggest that we tweak the language in the third paragraph to say that we remain willing to provide feedback instead of saying that we would like to 
mobile399	thanks again for your help 
mobile400	the language needs to say that enron has advised that it is willing to treat u. b. s. as an affiliate 
mobile401	i'll be thinking of you 
mobile402	has brian had his contract yet 
mobile403	regards 
mobile404	could you try ringing her 
mobile405	what a crazy day 
mobile406	did you set up a contract review session with patton or any dynegy folks for this a. m. 
mobile407	right now its a pissing match between watson and the banks 
mobile408	you didn't answer me about driving tomorrow 
mobile409	do you need it today 
mobile410	i intend to distribute something this week 
mobile411	i thought you were on six 
mobile412	will call later to explain 
mobile413	well that will be very similar to up here in the north country 
mobile414	joel will handle this 
mobile415	the contract is a bit complicated 
mobile416	steve gilbert is working on this 
mobile417	sure
mobile418	jim can you stay point on this exercise for the e. r. c. s. and other items 
mobile419	i am scared by his approach of one hundred twenty days for interconnection and sixty for f. e. r. c. 
mobile420	hi there 
mobile421	no word yet from legal on rolling el paso e. c. p. swaps back into e. n. a. and arguing setoff rights to get our collateral back we are posting el paso 
mobile422	there will be some better news later today
mobile423	what is going on 
mobile424	playdate sounds great 
mobile425	your kind thoughts are appreciated 
mobile426	tax gave us the same feedback 
mobile427	it's easier to control money if we have the conversations 
mobile428	make the move 
mobile429	keep me posted 
mobile430	there are several business issues outstanding 
mobile431	i will be thinking of you 
mobile432	let's have this meeting today tonight 
mobile433	who is this 
mobile434	john this message concerns me 
mobile435	did we plan that 
mobile436	the pedicure needs to be with someone else so it's at the same time 
mobile437	this will make my week 
mobile438	i'm leaving around noon tomorrow to catch a flight 
mobile439	i am glad that things are going well 
mobile440	on saturday chad has a three p. m. soccer game and a five thirty birthday party 
mobile441	i already had donna prepare a revised budget with people assigned directly to pipes and no cross pipe allocations 
mobile442	need anything from target 
mobile443	in the current environment i am less than confident i could sell the unsecured enron piece shortly 
mobile444	lynn and steve will attend for me 
mobile445	given the prior understanding we had that this transaction did not require board approval i do not think we can or should ask for that approval now 
mobile446	do we need to meet before the meeting with socal 
mobile447	any messages 
mobile448	i will be late on day one 
mobile449	chuck
mobile450	assume for now that we are running identical trading books as it should be easy to cut the ones we do not want 
mobile451	advice 
mobile452	i think i get this everyday now 
mobile453	add it all up we have a problem 
mobile454	very nice 
mobile455	i forgot to send the address list before we left for austin 
mobile456	today has been hard for me 
mobile457	let me know if i miss anything 
mobile458	i am trying to drive and email at the same time 
mobile459	thanks 
mobile460	i'll probably page you

mobile514	i have been in contact with him and he is familiar with the issues 
mobile515	presumably so do you 
mobile516	will two p. m. e. t. work for you 
mobile517	i think given that it's a liquid asset it should be priced more like p. r. m. activity than pure debt if it is to attract a capital charge 
mobile518	i know he has a lot going and doesn't have the crystal ball that i and others are looking for 
mobile519	what is happening to the stock price 
mobile520	why aren't we using the lower c. a. p. e. x. number with the lower rates 
mobile521	we have the data 
mobile522	sorry

mobile554	there is a marketing issue in relation to n. n. g. procedures on monitoring stranger's gas 
mobile555	for t. w. 
mobile556	you should definitely stay engaged with k. m. i. to see if we can do a deal 
mobile557	good to know that the f. e. r. c. cares

mobile568	eight seven seven three eight two nine five four one passcode four seven three two seven zero to answer some of the questions especially the c. e. r. a. questions 
mobile569	take what you can get 
mobile570	love dad 
mobile571	boy i couldn't write too much on this thing 
mobile572	i have no documents on this transaction 
mobile573	f. e. r. c. is interested for two reasons to understand that t. w. operates separately from its marketing affiliate and as part of determining t. w.'s capital structure and return in a rate case 
mobile574	evidently waiver was received but prohibits us from selling assets or prepaying debt without their approval 
mobile575	and yes i am learning how to use the blackberry reasonably well

mobile584	i would like to have a pedicure every four weeks at the same time as my manicure

mobile589	we've attached conditions to our commitment that i'd like to preserve 
mobile590	next time ask jim to call me

mobile666	is this because we have not rolled two thousand one actuals in and thru two thousand two plan 
mobile667	what a mess 
mobile668	e. e. s. and e. e. m. c. want to have the ability to pay more in advance i. e. change the terms to allow us to not fall below three days in escrow rather than having to refresh on a daily basis 
mobile669	louise 
mobile670	but it is quite powerful for communications and managing a group while traveling 
mobile671	i'll just have her call tracy 
mobile672	tim 
mobile673	suspicion is approx forty percent is due from e. n. a. to e. c. c. so it might get washed out in the consolidated e. a. reporting 
mobile674	i am looking forward to the salad 
mobile675	could you make a doctor's appointment for tomorrow for the doctor on level three 
mobile676	we're planning to go to west virginia for christmas

mobile877	i'll come have a beer with you guys later 
mobile878	the socal meeting was very beneficial 
mobile879	i'd be hesitant to show panic that we must sell the asset at any price prior to september thirtieth and trade real economic value and negotiate from a weaker position when we can have a clean sale two weeks later ideally before three q. earnings release 
mobile880	selling wessex is the right move for everyone

mobile1010	i'll be somewhere between pueblo and the royal gorge but i'll try to stop and patch in 
mobile1011	no employment claims for gas or power 
mobile1012	cash is king for now and we need the pricing to get the rest of the cash

mobile1014	we should change all references to say top ten customers provide sixty six percent of revenues

mobile1017	i met with dave duran yesterday to get his signature

mobile1024	it's fine 
mobile1025	what happened with brent price 
mobile1026	will be a while 
mobile1027	i expect that n. n. g. will make a new proposal to reflect peak cost responsibility as part of the next rate case 
mobile1028	why do you ask 
mobile1029	however i do not feel that the accounts for the resources should be disabled 
mobile1030	as you can see not everybody is always on board 
mobile1031	don't forget to pray 
mobile1032	is this in addition to the one with dan at one thirty 
mobile1033	okay i asked gary to have you decide on michael 
mobile1034	quick updates spoke with larry lawyer at e. g. m. 
mobile1035	nothing important 
mobile1036	i haven't asked hunter let's discuss in the morning 
mobile1037	there are a couple of slides in the recent bank package n. n. g. prepared and a few more slides in the original two thousand two budget package 
mobile1038	i love you too 
mobile1039	kevin howard will not be able to accompany us to phoenix 
mobile1040	ava please be sure tuesday afternoon is blocked for me to spend with the teams 
mobile1041	just told them i thought it would be impossible 
mobile1042	just kidding 
mobile1043	mahonia transaction is one way margin only because mahonia has already prepaid their leg of the transaction so there is never a scenario where the floating leg would be less than the fixed leg which has been bought down to zero so margining is not possible in that direction 
mobile1044	mike are you aware of this 
mobile1045	i am assuming from this that you are in which is great news 
mobile1046	rosco was great 
mobile1047	i'd be happy to 
mobile1048	walking in
mobile1049	this looks fine with me 
mobile1050	so how many times can people ask me if i am going to get let go this holiday 
mobile1051	does the state have copies of all programs 
mobile1052	my focus is on possibly dislodging money for orlando 
mobile1053	jeff
mobile1054	she has a web address 
mobile1055	you have a lot of holes in your plan 
mobile1056	mag

mobile1061	fannin is a mess by the dome and elsewhere 
mobile1062	sheila
mobile1063	thank you for your prompt reply 
mobile1064	he is leading the effort in our areas during this time of stress crisis for me 
mobile1065	i just want to make sure louise has the best data points for making a decision on my proposal of this morning 
mobile1066	great
mobile1067	can you wait until monday 
mobile1068	carol 
mobile1069	tied saint jerome one to one

mobile1071	i know several who work there 
mobile1072	i changed that in one prior draft 
mobile1073	t. x. u. is off everyone else okay 
mobile1074	i would like these as soon as possible and you can email to the c. c. addresses as well 
mobile1075	probably will be working 
mobile1076	given that the new structure requires a new market new rating agency process and new documentation we are effectively documenting and selling a new second transaction 
mobile1077	see you in enron house when i get back 
mobile1078	what is the cost issue 
mobile1079	i will resend to you 
mobile1080	please send me an email 
mobile1081	i will circle back with everyone later today 
mobile1082	what a jerk 
mobile1083	the amount of information we get is even worse as fred usually calls with updates and since you know nothing we know less 
mobile1084	banks want to exclude goodwill 
mobile1085	so i have an appointment every two weeks going forward for manicure and a pedicure every four weeks 
mobile1086	if you can obtain an unconditional commitment from a. p. s. go for it 
mobile1087	here's my work email kay mann enron com 
mobile1088	we are trying to get all issues resolved as quickly as possible 
mobile1089	i can fill you in later but there is no financeable value to the e. r. c. s. 
mobile1090	don't make me pull tapes on whether you understood our fee 
mobile1091	let's discuss 
mobile1092	i will review with marketing and the team when i get back

mobile1096	i think i feel better but i would like some comfort from the lawyer in the crew 
mobile1097	got your note 
mobile1098	i can look at it tonight 
mobile1099	it was a heroic effort on a very difficult and unusual financing 
mobile1100	i'll try

mobile1102	i'm in a meeting until noon 
mobile1103	don't know how that happened

mobile1115	if not julie and i will track them down this afternoon 
mobile1116	nothing for paige 
mobile1117	please send it to both of us 
mobile1118	i will if i want to 
mobile1119	mike mcgowan in omaha would be the only one who might know 
mobile1120	issue on post bankruptcy price risk issue remains 
mobile1121	barclays will be back tomorrow on whether they can proceed with rolling the existing s. o. two credits and at what price 
mobile1122	jan sorry for the inconvenience 
mobile1123	and if you want she could use a photo album or scrapbook for her story 
mobile1124	told him we'd expect him to turn the deals quickly 
mobile1125	we are on a plane coming back 
mobile1126	m.
mobile1127	finally i would delete the paragraph about lawyers 
mobile1128	also regarding the cash flow from canada 
mobile1129	i am sorry you had to come in 
mobile1130	david did it go out 
mobile1131	that is one of the things we are working on 
mobile1132	previously he had left it up to jeff who had said no 
mobile1133	hey
mobile1134	only as a last resort should we want to redo 
mobile1135	i got it pal 
mobile1136	my mobile number is seven one three four zero eight zero nine two nine 
mobile1137	i'm out today so don't wait on me to file 
mobile1138	dave 
mobile1139	but we typically send a p. d. f. file that contains all of our info by email 
mobile1140	ben could tell him about pompano 
mobile1141	i think this just happened friday 
mobile1142	if you need a signature fax it to the hotel 
mobile1143	what enron entity owns the e. o. t. t. g. p. 
mobile1144	the dial in network is down so elizabeth is headed into the office to get the p. g. e. capacity release report 
mobile1145	i agree with morris
mobile1146	i think we should put a number on the table 
mobile1147	i'm walking lenders through e. n. a. on off b. s. debt and why majority is not and must not be considered enron recourse for sizing additional leverage 
mobile1148	given gary's presentation on bonus timing i plan to turn in my recommendation today 
mobile1149	tell everyone to calm down and get their work done 
mobile1150	let me know when you get this 
mobile1151	i wanted to go drinking with you 
mobile1152	trader support group
mobile1153	aloha 
mobile1154	jordan is taking christina mordant's last job corporate development 
mobile1155	b. collins n. y. m. e. x. com
mobile1156	it is rough still but looks like we can stay within budget for each pipe 
mobile1157	i will make meatloaf for dinner when i get home 
mobile1158	no material impact 
mobile1159	dan wanted to tell you that there is leftover potato casserole on the top shelf of the fridge

mobile1169	thanks
mobile1170	very cute 
mobile1171	things are okay 
mobile1172	please make sure bob kelley is on the list 
mobile1173	the comment that troubles me more is that we are fully contracted west thru two thousand five 
mobile1174	michael was great this a. m. 
mobile1175	can you send me an invitation for the two meetings on monday in outlook 
mobile1176	i think it's over now 
mobile1177	gary made it sound like you had decided to lose michael 
mobile1178	it's not working very well 
mobile1179	i'm not familiar with the individual assets might include gaspart and c. e. g. r. i. o. of that structure but the critical asset apparently is a six hundred ninety million dollar loan to enron 
mobile1180	i think that is right but i do not have the data to confirm that 
mobile1181	get then to ring greg if necessary i really want to be able to tell people i've signed 
mobile1182	i agree with jim 
mobile1183	i trust that everyone already understands what is contracted and the only concern is our recontracting capability 
mobile1184	i need your home cell or whatever 
mobile1185	still planning it it might be just worth joining by phone to check the state of play 
mobile1186	mike i'm afraid i have a conflict in san diego on behalf of ken lay those days 
mobile1187	let him pursue his claims with everyone else 
mobile1188	there is an article about the legal department 
mobile1189	we are in forty nine c. one 
mobile1190	if all goes well i think we can be done by mid october 
mobile1191	how completely horrible 
mobile1192	if not can i call you 
mobile1193	there are approximately fifty counterparties that we want to hit in the first week of business 
mobile1194	we are still in palacios having a quiet a. m. 
mobile1195	as prices fall we effectively begin to repay the transaction 
mobile1196	no to both 
mobile1197	she is a baylor graduate and is very nice 
mobile1198	without the language on assignment in the l. c. if you move the underlying trades to a permitted affiliate the l. c. would not follow 
mobile1199	we've already eliminated his speech therapy 
mobile1200	but i would like a waiver so i think we should consider some sort of payment 
mobile1201	f. y. i. on the demand letter i signed earlier 
mobile1202	ava please put on my calendar 
mobile1203	then there is adoption stuff and then there is world news 
mobile1204	i also just received my blackberry cool 
mobile1205	i have alina at the doctor for her physical this afternoon but we should be home by six p. m. and be home all evening 
mobile1206	confirmed with mark taylor 
mobile1207	i am really hoping that you will have some time to be my therapist this weekend 
mobile1208	yes plus the ability to grow or to keep the i. t. p. n. r. and other revenue 
mobile1209	in fact i think we were going to move everyone into e. n. a. and have them hired by netco after closing 
mobile1210	do you still need me to sign something 
mobile1211	good morning 
mobile1212	steve 
mobile1213	so does this mean mimi's email is up and running 
mobile1214	if we want to sell then we need to file and wait 
mobile1215	i have a quick meeting with legal on interpreting the contract ambiguity regarding curtailment this morning and can fill you in on all those discussions shortly 
mobile1216	not yet 
mobile1217	i will be checking up with lisa 
mobile1218	i will likely not be available 
mobile1219	fran is trying to get with mcmahon to get his take on them 
mobile1220	i'm on six 
mobile1221	and also can you start planning to have infinity up and running on day one 
mobile1222	frank
mobile1223	do you have or bob copies of n. n. g.'s debt agreements current 
mobile1224	had conference calls with godfrey lamb and mitchell on indian mesa two 
mobile1225	the issue is that in order to sell the units there is a public disclosure of the units being in rawhide which may have some more issues 
mobile1226	still waiting on decision 
mobile1227	all i need is for you to prepare a one sentence description of the set off deal 
mobile1228	i gather you heard about six to seven for cornhusker for this quarter 
mobile1229	what happened 
mobile1230	i still get seven to eight people every day whining about the trading versus marketing thing 
mobile1231	i'll meet you at bill sperry's office at twelve thirty 
mobile1232	it is probably a good idea to go and stay downtown 
mobile1233	i love you 
mobile1234	got here early 
mobile1235	it consists of rocks he has picked up at the park and a few gems he bought at a museum 
mobile1236	knock yourself out 
mobile1237	we are working on it but in the grand scheme of things it is kind of a back burner issue 
mobile1238	how can we get these answers 
mobile1239	i am trying to get a decision but i think we need to maintain flexibility if at all possible 
mobile1240	you hang in there too 
mobile1241	i received three letters stating that since i am no longer with enron i can access and move my savings plan 
mobile1242	got your message 
mobile1243	what's your proposal 
mobile1244	can we meet at three thirty 
mobile1245	chuck's numbers he walked you through earlier assumed one hundred b. p. s. in fees so we are slightly better than forecast 
mobile1246	six fifteen and still going but should be done by six thirty 
mobile1247	both of us are still here 
mobile1248	developing valuation methodology for e. t. s. interest sun devil 
mobile1249	did you send out a global message from me 
mobile1250	chuck ward
mobile1251	not even in yet 
mobile1252	barry hope that you had a great christmas 
mobile1253	i am still uncomfortable doing anything with n. n. g.'s swaps until someone can tell me who the swaps are with who the confirms are with what underlying contracts are being terminated and what are the ramifications of the termination 
mobile1254	i will 
mobile1255	m. o. u. signed
mobile1256	i don't want to let my nanny go home if you think you need me 
mobile1257	see you then
mobile1258	the rest is a byproduct of slapshot 
mobile1259	heightened state of awareness down there with the flow of info 
mobile1260	disney was great and i've been to eight baseball games 
mobile1261	still i'm always up for opera 
mobile1262	just so you know john arnold asked me this morning about individuals on e. o. l. 
mobile1263	ava please put on my calendar 
mobile1264	we will keep trying 
mobile1265	much better than carrying a laptop 
mobile1266	i know a live plant is risky but i figured people buy cut trees and stick them in water so what the heck 
mobile1267	any interest in chatting about a job at u. b. s. 
mobile1268	email the consent to me 
mobile1269	i spoke with g. p. benefits counsel this morning 
mobile1270	one number of questions on this 
mobile1271	how soon do you need it 
mobile1272	i think what you are proposing should be fine but it would help to understand the background 
mobile1273	how are things with you 
mobile1274	yep
mobile1275	michael said his day was rotten 
mobile1276	dan boyle mentioned that today is the deadline for the rawhide amendment

mobile1290	i am not aware of any 
mobile1291	can you get my contract ready for me to sign tomorrow at two p. m. 
mobile1292	two point seven five billion dollars and counting 
mobile1293	perhaps there was a glitch 
mobile1294	i am going to start preparing documents to terminate our involvement with a. i. g. 
mobile1295	thinks p. w. r. suppliers in california should be worried about getting paid the long term contracts rates 
mobile1296	also hope you can make sense of this email 
mobile1297	i hope to provide you with a more detailed answer after consulting reliable travel guides and weather almanacs 
mobile1298	it would be similar to having the b. o. d. of enron turning down a project with frevert kitchen and duran support with a signed dash 
mobile1299	what number should he call you on 
mobile1300	we are proceeding with a great reception so far 
mobile1301	you can reply via email

mobile1303	ray
mobile1304	there was a rawhide bankers meeting late yesterday to consider enron's request to delay the call by several weeks

mobile1329	we need to talk about this month

mobile1331	any questions about these items and you can typically get the quickest estimate or actual from me 
mobile1332	contact me tomorrow at three zero three two seven eight eight four nine two prior to emailing me the document as discussed below

mobile1666	steve and i have been asked to work with mcgown and steve kirk on the s. l. a. settlement 
mobile1667	as to solicitation of employees back and forth it will be a negotiated deal term

mobile1671	can you get with mary and make sure

mobile1691	what's wrong 
mobile1692	he will walk tanya rohauer through the exact same steps tomorrow

mobile1715	nightmare 
mobile1716	see you on the third

mobile1863	i'm in stan's office 
mobile1864	i have some gift certificates for ann t. gap and gymboree 
mobile1865	however you would have to agree that we have some level of control over the g. p. 
mobile1866	it's death or dynegy with no clear leader 
mobile1867	i don't think they formally backed out but effectively that is what has happened 
mobile1868	forty million dollars in by tuesday

mobile1870	tim's assistant tried to pull rank on my assistant because we are a trading company now

mobile1875	we will be managing our rates and we need to plan on software

mobile1887	the troops just walked in 
mobile1888	don't forget the wood 
mobile1889	it is no problem 
mobile1890	we need to give them a defined group for day one

mobile1892	good plan 
mobile1893	i'm available by cell when you get data points

mobile1895	but we should pay them the four thousand five hundred 
mobile1896	did you budget to use the company plane in two thousand two 
mobile1897	both
mobile1898	thanks lynn 
mobile1899	this seems fine to me 
mobile1900	i need a chauffeur when we arrive to take us either to king's cross to get a train or go all the way home 
mobile1901	i will tell them 
mobile1902	skyline refers to added seasonality that n. n. g. proposed to add to its rates

mobile1904	j. w. b.
mobile1905	greg

mobile1908	seemed fine when i picked him up 
mobile1909	we can work with it either way 
mobile1910	about time
mobile1911	i enjoyed our discussion very much 
mobile1912	there is some type of retrade underway from the bill wise level 
mobile1913	i would think that if they pay in advance it should not be a problem 
mobile1914	hi
mobile1915	are you back in town 
mobile1916	answer is you would get severance and their plan is quite generous presuming r. i. f. rather than performance reason for separation 
mobile1917	i am forwarding all the emails to her attention 
mobile1918	hanover deal done 
mobile1919	let's make sure we have all bases covered and telephone tree in place 
mobile1920	i think f. m. v. is probably less than fifty

mobile1929	what a pain 
mobile1930	i thought you needed him to carry two people 
mobile1931	i think in this case specific is better 
mobile1932	pressure to finish my review 
mobile1933	i like it 
mobile1934	san francisco was interconnect meeting 
mobile1935	about fifteen minutes 
mobile1936	the commercial staff has been very concerned about the lack of daily data and i haven't made much headway with the g. m. s. folks 
mobile1937	so it is all in ginger's hands now 
mobile1938	i approve 
mobile1939	i have thirty minutes then 
mobile1940	mikey is invited also 
mobile1941	jim 
mobile1942	why don't you ask shanna funkhouser for the details

mobile1953	i have master counterparty lists from credit legal and e. o. l. 
mobile1954	i don't know how to get in touch with mike outside of the office 
mobile1955	you might say that we are lending the money to enron and therefore are now looking further than n. n. g. and n. w. 
mobile1956	could i ask the two of you to please insure that there is a refreshed view on the legal risks relative to both our and el paso's litigation on east coast power 
mobile1957	did you mean oxley 
mobile1958	who should i contact regarding severance 
mobile1959	we are going to hedge manage our own interest rate risk so we will need infinity so can you please make sure it's infinity add ons is in the document

mobile1967	mom's email is r. m. c. call airmail net 
mobile1968	i'm taking wednesday off 
mobile1969	i can get them 
mobile1970	just a thought i think our p. r. people and outside law firm should stop referring to netco as a joint venture it hurts our ability to get commercial and regulatory agreements in place 
mobile1971	j. a. always understands 
mobile1972	i don't know who what got everything stirred up today 
mobile1973	where do you want to meet to go over there 
mobile1974	dallas 
mobile1975	i am monitoring email

mobile1979	i will need you to resurrect your language on the gas for mitch tomorrow

mobile1986	after that meeting dari mary and i are going to review procedures for any changes 
mobile1987	ava please get with t. k. and let her know if we have some pens she can have 
mobile1988	if jeff says it is okay then i take comfort in that given my relationship with jeff 
mobile1989	incredible 
mobile1990	i have received your messages and will respond accordingly 
mobile1991	i make this about fifteen full time people and probably the equivalent of another seven to ten for these other functions plus their expenses 
mobile1992	so it reads u. b. s. warburg energy 
mobile1993	eric
mobile1994	still tied up 
mobile1995	i likely will be arriving late so probably should pass 
mobile1996	i'm not close enough right now to the discussion 
mobile1997	just my thoughts

mobile2001	robyn

mobile2057	i would like an updated copy of the schedule you brought me with a description from the representatives about why the customer is saying that they haven't paid 
mobile2058	it will all be public someday 
mobile2059	one final new year's email the netco startup plan for power is assuming forty five to sixty days to get a f. e. r. c. license sixty to one hundred twenty days to get transmission and pool agreements etcetera so transaction volumes will be trivial for the first few months unless we look at some new approaches such as buying a small marketer 
mobile2060	we will get you a copy 
mobile2061	you are welcome in palacios this weekend of course 
mobile2062	thanks having a good time

mobile2077	no at least not to my knowledge 
mobile2078	i will follow up with him as soon as the dust settles 
mobile2079	michelle lokey has two hundred sixty nine thousand coming in from w. m. b. as an o. b. a. settlement today or tomorrow into the new account

mobile2081	regarding canada rob is predicting four hundred sixty two million dollars canadian cash balance for year end

mobile2085	do you have a number for steve 
mobile2086	i vote for the latter

mobile2088	here is the message 
mobile2089	we don't want to look bad to dyn

mobile2094	either way we will limit further funds from going out the door

mobile2098	it may be an hour 
mobile2099	hi sue 
mobile2100	heather dunton
mobile2101	no i am not interested in getting certified in monterey bay 
mobile2102	i think it is best for her not to work here as she obviously wasn't happy 
mobile2103	jim please confirm to vince you are happy 
mobile2104	we are also doing a due diligence all day thursday with dynegy on n. n. g. 
mobile2105	if he'll sign no issues with barclays 
mobile2106	presuming they did seems to me it is reasonable to assume this is what the deal will actually be lance also mentioned creditor committee had seen umbrella's term sheet last week 
mobile2107	please transfer the balance from my personal to my corporate 
mobile2108	the assets are still warehoused off balance sheet and fortunately el paso's credit spreads have been trading in to our benefit

mobile2111	where's jeanie 
mobile2112	hope your week is going well

mobile2117	is this the only time available 
mobile2118	we just pulled schedules from the web

mobile2129	even michael was impressed 
mobile2130	no there will be plenty of others 
mobile2131	i woke up and couldn't get back to sleep 
mobile2132	however let's wait and see if we can get one more draft done for wednesday 
mobile2133	what is the purpose of this 
mobile2134	to the degree the underlying asset would support less than book value upon a quick liquidation the put call price protection embeds more enron risk in the financing 
mobile2135	i have not seen any numbers nor have i heard from faith 
mobile2136	first objective is to keep electricity flowing 
mobile2137	there is a possibility socal could reduce capacity at i d. two 
mobile2138	heard your name on t. v. last night 
mobile2139	i will try to reach you on wednesday 
mobile2140	what do you think about that sir 
mobile2141	looks good 
mobile2142	eleven forty five
mobile2143	please ask wes to come over for nine thirty or earlier 
mobile2144	we need to send read only i. d.'s to all our customers 
mobile2145	i plan to work tomorrow some on the data and can hopefully get you something for friday 
mobile2146	no can do 
mobile2147	if you guys already mulched last week then i can manage the planting on my own 
mobile2148	they are specifically concerned about the current intercompany notes 
mobile2149	nice weather for it 
mobile2150	i think those are the right dates 
mobile2151	love me 
mobile2152	accounting has been able to look in and find that they actually did have a third party 
mobile2153	but i hope to see you at kari's house 
mobile2154	please send me an email describing the changes he is requesting 
mobile2155	do you want to go to the cafeteria for lunch 
mobile2156	is there a meeting with kevin howard today on this 
mobile2157	see you soon
mobile2158	does friday at ten work for you 
mobile2159	thai sounds good 
mobile2160	i would suggest adding an acknowledgement at the bottom where the person accepts the terms and conditions of the assignment letter and also authorizes the company to deduct the amounts described in the letter from final paycheck vacation pay or other amounts to be paid to employee 
mobile2161	this message is about new building tour 
mobile2162	i enjoyed our discussion very much and was very impressed with your accomplishments and experience 
mobile2163	starting when 
mobile2164	i can be there within the hour 
mobile2165	fingers crossed 
mobile2166	you too 
mobile2167	do you want to fax it to my hotel 
mobile2168	would you like to take cam 
mobile2169	he walked me through outstanding issues on alamac that he is working with duran and heather to resolve 
mobile2170	i do not need the bill to go to my home address

mobile2172	i meant to try and explain not to redo 
mobile2173	cool is it not 
mobile2174	see you later 
mobile2175	i just told kathy to send an email to my direct reports 
mobile2176	also please check with k. young to see what is in place 
mobile2177	frankly i would rather have a. k. across from us than other counsel because i think that they will be cognizant of future potential and probably won't be too obnoxious 
mobile2178	can i get electronic copies of these they have volumes and margins and appear to back up the revenue projections 
mobile2179	we cannot say the interstate pipelines are agreeing as this would take agreement of our partners 
mobile2180	the covering memo should be explicit in asking the e. e. to confirm that if a deal was presented in substantially these terms they would sign them 
mobile2181	is derrick okay with it 
mobile2182	so i'll see you at the airport 
mobile2183	did you differ from me 
mobile2184	if anyone asks just say i'm in dallas and you don't know why 
mobile2185	right 
mobile2186	my husband is in indonesia on business so don't be surprised if i reply in the middle of the night when kids are asleep and i can concentrate 
mobile2187	number 
mobile2188	thanks for your help in quickly setting this up 
mobile2189	hang in there guys 
mobile2190	works for me 
mobile2191	thanks that's what i was hoping it was 
mobile2192	it will interfere with every dinner theatre social event you plan 
mobile2193	cool
