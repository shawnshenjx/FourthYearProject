mobile1	Thanks, I will look at it tonight.
mobile2	She also wants us to hire everyone who is out on leave immediately instead of having them show up when released.
mobile3	On its way
mobile4	Joe
mobile5	I fear death is making a strong push down the backstretch.
mobile6	I've got a call into Wes to see if these numbers were in the second current estimate or not.
mobile7	This will be hard.
mobile8	Hopefully it cheered you up a bit.
mobile9	We are working on this as we speak.
mobile10	How much volume?
mobile11	Interesting, are you around for a late lunch?
mobile12	How about 9 in my office on 3825?
mobile13	Have a good evening.
mobile14	Sounds good to me.
mobile15	Yes I am here actually.
mobile16	Tonight is my anniversary.
mobile17	Thanks, I think we have taken care of this.
mobile18	Will follow up today.
mobile19	That's a lot of dollars.
mobile20	Are you going to join us for lunch?
mobile21	Thanks for the surprise.
mobile22	Spoke with Greg.
mobile23	I'm at the doctor's office this AM, but will be in the office later.
mobile24	I will have to check to see who handles the paralegal hiring.
mobile25	I can't find it on my Blackberry.
mobile26	And how would I be going for work?
mobile27	Yes.
mobile28	I hoped you did.
mobile29	J. Robert Collins
mobile30	Evaluating KMI lease offer on Sonoran project.
mobile31	Early to my appointment, so I'm working some.
mobile32	OK to make changes, change out original.
mobile33	That would probably be the easiest time to give them up.
mobile34	Murray,
mobile35	I heard it was at 5?
mobile36	Love,
mobile37	I have no idea who told John this as I haven't had a discussion on this issue since 1999.
mobile38	We'll let you know.
mobile39	Do you want to eat lunch somewhere before?
mobile40	Eric,
mobile41	Further out - will fax you price target slide.
mobile42	FYI, would she meet my requirements?
mobile43	Other than the Trigen deal, let me know if there are other deals that are a problem and I will look into them.
mobile44	Agreed.
mobile45	Davis had not yet updated the model for this.
mobile46	I'm thinking 3 and 4 are not as nice as 5 and 6, but that this would be OK, and preferable to moving to the North Tower and that we should be trying for a longer lease, with breaks we can exercise at our option.
mobile47	Yes I am coming twice.
mobile48	Somewhere convenient to Jim since he has to come from Beltway/EOTT.
mobile49	GP
mobile50	Sorry I'm losing it.
mobile51	FYI, I have heard from some folks that business folks think that too many HR people are gone, so I think they may be OK with numbers.
mobile52	If not, he's gone on Tuesday.
mobile53	If R. Hannigrif is fine with it, then I will be good.
mobile54	Thank you, dear.
mobile55	This looks good.
mobile56	Thanks so much for the message.
mobile57	I would hope costs would be lower on future additions.
mobile58	Let's start with this and add more later.
mobile59	Got it.
mobile60	Let me know if I can do anything.
mobile61	No, but thank you for offering.
mobile62	Thank you!
mobile63	Why is there a note showing NNG as a borrower from Enron?
mobile64	Fuel is retained in kind from the shippers.
mobile65	I'm in traffic.
mobile66	Per deal, if we don't reach agreement by noon, we have to call credits for payment Wednesday.
mobile67	Approved
mobile68	If so he probably will have to pay back.
mobile69	He can't help himself.
mobile70	I am only concerned that when the situation changes that we will not be willing to discuss the opposite and the question still remains as to what the form 2 (regulatory) will require.
mobile71	I'll let you know the next time I'll be in DC and you are always welcome to hop on down to Houston for a weekend.
mobile72	I haven't heard back from Steve at all.
mobile73	I have already approved and forwarded.
mobile74	Still want to try and get it done this year.
mobile75	Hope so.
mobile76	Thanks for your offer.
mobile77	I will prepare a contract summary along the lines of what Pete prepared for MCV.
mobile78	Was it a car wreck?
mobile79	Let Gary Smith know today if you want him.
mobile80	Please forward to Andy Edison and Stuart Zisman.
mobile81	I can't get attachments - please send text copy.
mobile82	How are we handling others in that group?
mobile83	Don't make it harder than it needs to be.
mobile84	OK by me.
mobile85	James should be in and I can tell him or Steve where to get schedules.
mobile86	Yes and yes, but it will take me another day or so for the announcement.
mobile87	I have a 10 AM with Dynegy to discuss bullpen list.
mobile88	Is the system running OK this morning?
mobile89	Is she done yet?
mobile90	My home email is kay.mann@worldnet.att.net.
mobile91	Frank
mobile92	Ned for McMahon meeting at 1.
mobile93	Do you have copies of the agreements?
mobile94	2 - no MSA contains a release from Enron to USB and EE's who "are hired" by UBS.
mobile95	Thanks for the quick turnaround.
mobile96	I think it is a mistake but if we need to hit a number it is doable - if Amy can provide the support by always having a line of communication open and visiting Portland every few weeks.
mobile97	Have a good weekend.
mobile98	Ava please print and give to Steve to bring to Omaha.
mobile99	I can then accept and get it on my calendar in the office.
mobile100	I'm hoping I can bring Alina and make a play date for Chad.
mobile101	How are you?
mobile102	7133042519
mobile103	See you on Friday.
mobile104	I better go.
mobile105	Thanks DS
mobile106	Dennis M and Hal K will send a fax to Stan this afternoon (3 PM) regarding Enron's interests in NBP.
mobile107	More bad Enron news?
mobile108	I think we are dong OK.
mobile109	Michael has his holiday performance.
mobile110	Any word?
mobile111	Not just 1 to 2.
mobile112	Here's the talking points for ANNGTC.
mobile113	Ckm
mobile114	The only change would be the date.
mobile115	Kidding
mobile116	We have been looking into that form of delivering training.
mobile117	I'll confirm.
mobile118	The filing concerns various scheduling and balancing rules.
mobile119	You'll be OK.
mobile120	You don't need to get it signed, just substitute the new pages.
mobile121	Please send to Hartsoe for comment.
mobile122	We are headed to Austin tomorrow.
mobile123	Please call Debbie and ask her to fax you a copy of the executed guaranty.
mobile124	I didn't hear from Ginger this week.
mobile125	Thus have nothing to destroy.
mobile126	Very foggy this AM.
mobile127	He is pretty tapped into it all.
mobile128	I am out of town until Friday.
mobile129	Wish me luck with Linda.
mobile130	Yes, I am playing.
mobile131	Can you call me at home?
mobile132	FYI Rick
mobile133	You can call me if you want or else I am going to crash.
mobile134	Mostly a social call.
mobile135	We will sign tomorrow and fund Tuesday.
mobile136	After I get all info I will probably consolidate and give to Sharon for keeping but I think it makes sense for me to consolidate all info on these employees.
mobile137	I'm still in FW.
mobile138	Can you rough out a slide on rating agencies?
mobile139	Please call tomorrow if possible.
mobile140	We are all fragile.
mobile141	Depends on price.
mobile142	Please forward all necessary data and models per the NetCo agreement.
mobile143	We are waiting on the higher ups to fill us in on what we are negotiating.
mobile144	It will probably be tomorrow.
mobile145	Pretty impressive win!
mobile146	Is Stan looking for a go / no go decision?
mobile147	We are delayed, got another 30 minutes on the runway.
mobile148	I would like to attend if so.
mobile149	It better not be about me!
mobile150	The party at AA is Roger Willard 713 646 6360.
mobile151	On first glance it looks like many of the items relate to capacity release or Peoples.
mobile152	He played goalie almost the entire game.
mobile153	We do need to discuss ECP debt today if you're available.
mobile154	Did you read the Chronicle this AM?
mobile155	I can return earlier.
mobile156	I am trying again.
mobile157	I am in 50M if you need me.
mobile158	If you want us to pursue getting this cash directly to ENE we will be happy to try.
mobile159	If the same exists for 2000 can we get it as well.
mobile160	I am on my way to Heaven.
mobile161	Would you mind taking the lead on this?
mobile162	I'll see you Thursday October 25.
mobile163	Shelley, will you have time or interest in attending this informational meeting?
mobile164	FYI
mobile165	I have taken the time to listen to all of your concerns and have responded below appropriately.
mobile166	Do you want us to spend the money if the alternative is no content?
mobile167	What does "held" mean?
mobile168	My feeling is that once they affirmatively decide they are going to Florida, you should say that I rented a house and that you are going to come over and stay with us for a few days.
mobile169	I think that the costs may be high, but I would like your evaluation of the product.
mobile170	We agreed to have a children's church meeting tacked on to the end of the next children's ministry meeting.
mobile171	Obviously, this is not an issue with huge time sensitivity.
mobile172	MO
mobile173	Probably can handle Monday PM.
mobile174	I will bring John Brindle.
mobile175	So, I went shopping today and saw lots of things!
mobile176	936 597 3905
mobile177	For sure.
mobile178	Need you or John to step out.
mobile179	We probably have to discuss trade behavior and margin.
mobile180	We will meet you at 6:30 even if John is late.
mobile181	Also, spoke with Joe Gold and he can be ready to move his $300M quickly through Barclays as well.
mobile182	Chad thought we were on a treasure hunt.
mobile183	I thought I sent Jim an email over the weekend.
mobile184	Can't get anyone at Enron to think that far ahead.
mobile185	But I have been reading my emails along the way and know about all the meetings next week.
mobile186	Offered 92.5 BPS in fees to Bofa this AM.
mobile187	You can explain this to me next week or over the weekend.
mobile188	Kevin needs to set up meetings with DUK, PGE, SEM during first week of December.
mobile189	I did talk to Connie the travel broker and she said that she was just holding our visa stuff pending instructions from Chris Ivins.
mobile190	By the way, I met yesterday with an internal candidate who did not have requisite experience.
mobile191	When Dan mentions MLP, is he referring to using border or setting up a new one?
mobile192	Friends help.
mobile193	He would love anything about rocks.
mobile194	I totally understand but we now have a real problem with regard to the timeline.
mobile195	The 65 BPS was computed for the original transaction for which we drafted dox and received ratings from S&P and Moody's.
mobile196	Rod,
mobile197	Of course not
mobile198	What do you hear?
mobile199	I have received many replies that the message is undeliverable.
mobile200	I asked what Dan will be doing, but the person I talked to didn't know.
mobile201	Thanks I needed that today!
mobile202	I will review them on Monday.
mobile203	Maybe I should just stay there for good.
mobile204	I think the benefits information already is in what we sent to Katie Caplan as well.
mobile205	My only constraint is Chad's noon soccer game.
mobile206	No problem Maria, please contact Rick.
mobile207	I'll call you when I get downstairs tomorrow AM.
mobile208	203 561 9796- cell
mobile209	I will try and arrange to sit down and look at the most recent numbers.
mobile210	A bit behind on my emails.
mobile211	Then we can go to Zainy Brainy.
mobile212	Hope your trip to Florida was good.
mobile213	We started talking about possibility of TXU resetting eastern contract and writing us a big check (discount for early pay to be negotiated based on size).
mobile214	Please call.
mobile215	Love
mobile216	Hi, how are things there?
mobile217	What is your issue sir?
mobile218	For your information.
mobile219	I need to postpone our 4pm meeting as I want to go to the Cantor memorial service.
mobile220	What a nice note.
mobile221	I told Gary you could make the call.
mobile222	Agreed
mobile223	I would rather fund seven days in advance each Monday.
mobile224	I think we should consider this request.
mobile225	I'm supposed to talk to Ben and Steve today.
mobile226	What's his problem?
mobile227	Greg is not back yet either so we still don't know real numbers.
mobile228	She called and wants to come over this AM.
mobile229	There is now a meeting at 8PM as well.
mobile230	Paige is gone.
mobile231	I'll check around I have a good friend who works there.
mobile232	See you soon!
mobile233	I'm on my way back there to do so.
mobile234	I have no way of seeing the slide on my Blackberry.
mobile235	Bound to be some media flack on this.
mobile236	Understood
mobile237	Love, Kay.
mobile238	Hi Bev,
mobile239	Robert Guthrie
mobile240	Be back tomorrow and maybe we can visit.
mobile241	Have meeting.
mobile242	Dale
mobile243	I know this might push us to the point of her asking whether they can stay with us, but I'm afraid the kids will spill the beans.
mobile244	Stan's office
mobile245	Neal, can you help with this?
mobile246	Haedicke has given me Travis and Mary Cook as legal and I understand they are digging through the contracts.
mobile247	Well that's OK if we don't - I have no idea what Stockman's view is and he is back tomorrow.
mobile248	Will let you know how Barclays responds on these ERCS, etc.
mobile249	Christie.
mobile250	Call Luitgard Fischer.
mobile251	We should talk with someone in IT who is supporting CAPS to make sure they know the potential issues.
mobile252	They want us to record the amounts loaned, normal loans, as a reduction of equity, if ENE does not currently have the ability to repay from either cash or other assets or credit capability.
mobile253	Best of luck and stay in touch.
mobile254	Rick Buy
mobile255	John, thanks for the update.
mobile256	Oh oh
mobile257	Scotty and I will be in NYC.
mobile258	That was the discussion late last night
mobile259	Until we can answer these questions, we cannot terminate anything.
mobile260	I was answering Janet's comment.
mobile261	Could you start working on the trip to the UK at Christmas?
mobile262	So should I drive tomorrow?
mobile263	Ouch
mobile264	How would you explain the difference between the two?
mobile265	Suffice it to say all of these things will be taken care of before it funds.
mobile266	Is Kathy here?
mobile267	Do you think you will need me to come back into the office tonight?
mobile268	Scotty Gilbert
mobile269	If so send me an email and I will come up before I leave for the hanger.
mobile270	I have a favor to ask.
mobile271	Get with Dot.
mobile272	If I understand the question, the answer is that we only have to seek approval for corporate changes to TW, the regulated entity.
mobile273	Question 3: The diving is supposed to be quite "killer" (as you put it).
mobile274	I'm still in Dallas!
mobile275	Thanks.
mobile276	We are on the road to Palacios.
mobile277	We told them that we were keen to deal but needed commitment.
mobile278	I'm in the waiting room of the ENT now.
mobile279	Probably need to check with HR group providing services.
mobile280	Check with Haedicke
mobile281	It reads like she is in.
mobile282	Oh my, perhaps I've given you the wrong idea about the sophistication of Chad's rock collection.
mobile283	Is Cassandra there today?
mobile284	Let us know if you have suggestions on a replacement.
mobile285	DS and LS
mobile286	Heather tells me there are only two remaining issues so I'll follow up on those.
mobile287	I like Nick and Everett.
mobile288	Shouldn't be too hard though.
mobile289	I saw an offer letter to Teresa Staab so if we didn't give it to her it's on the reserve list somewhere.
mobile290	In a couple of weeks.
mobile291	Has Dynegy made a specific request?
mobile292	I am walking in now.
mobile293	Bill
mobile294	They have capacity now.
mobile295	Sounds good.
mobile296	I am here today, I am in Stan's staff meeting.
mobile297	Unfortunately we do not know what the deal is.
mobile298	Is this cash coming into TW?
mobile299	Will he come down Wetheimer?
mobile300	I will call in 20 to 30 minutes.
mobile301	With regards to the existing deal, the setup costs and timeline was primarily the result of working out the kinks on legal/accounting structures to find a deal structure both sides could live with.
mobile302	Did you add the sections on what we want NewCo to do for the employees?
mobile303	Happy Thanksgiving!
mobile304	I'm replying real-time, using my Blackberry while in a meeting in California with Pickering.
mobile305	We are still transitioning and Alina had a fit as we were leaving a friend's house to come to choir.
mobile306	If the reimbursement doesn't show up then there is no offset and the dollars spent should end up in rate base.
mobile307	Especially Peoples.
mobile308	I'm fine.
mobile309	She had your name on the list she pulled so I am confused.
mobile310	A gift isn't necessary.
mobile311	We are planning to attend, although I am going to a networking happy hour at my old firm.
mobile312	It is all about keeping the banks at bay and DYN interested.
mobile313	Tell her to get my expense report done.
mobile314	I am out of town on business tonight.
mobile315	Unclear whether DYN is in and the total deal is for 750M, or DYN is out and it is a $500M transaction.
mobile316	Currently at the drug test - there is a long list of people from ENE who have been here today.
mobile317	Agree
mobile318	We need a process to deal with this.
mobile319	I'm waiting until she comes home.
mobile320	Not even close.
mobile321	I have an AM doctor's appointment.
mobile322	See you next week.
mobile323	This is the neatest toy I have had.
mobile324	It was in a yellow interoffice envelope, real yellow, not the regular manila colored.
mobile325	See you later.
mobile326	I offered to form up a study effort with them since they would be a crucial shipper.
mobile327	In the European CSFB prepay which was just extended, Morgan Stanley was also involved for a related swap of the same amount.
mobile328	I heard we had preliminary good feedback from Cadwalader on pledging contracts.
mobile329	Chris Foster is in!
mobile330	I have none.
mobile331	And we can send out an email on our staff meeting on Monday.
mobile332	I've been thinking about them for several weeks and haven't made up my mind.
mobile333	No, but thanks.
mobile334	They are more efficiently pooled.
mobile335	This isn't the language that we agreed on and it will cause serious objections from my camp.
mobile336	I will send them a letter telling them that we will be covering.
mobile337	I have other things to worry about!
mobile338	We'll be in State College around July 4.
mobile339	Dan is convinced that he (Dan) will be laid off, and I'm worn out trying to talk him out of the feeling.
mobile340	Hole is unlikely, but is a real weak point in any sales discussion.
mobile341	I may take the opportunity to run some errands.
mobile342	This is a problem for timing of restart.
mobile343	I will call you Monday morning to discuss.
mobile344	Let's discuss in the morning.
mobile345	Mich
mobile346	Thanks for yours and Donna's efforts to get this before I left.
mobile347	I should be back in the office on Wednesday.
mobile348	I guess.
mobile349	Same camp as Davies, Lagrasta.
mobile350	Sarah
mobile351	From whom?
mobile352	I didn't understand we were borrowing them.
mobile353	Please call.
mobile354	If he does not have it, we will have to call Trailblazer directly.
mobile355	As a further indication of their confidence, the deal team is spending three days in Vail this week, with family, to recuperate.
mobile356	In general if a person turns down an offer to go to a divested company, it is considered a voluntary termination/resignation.
mobile357	Michelle tells me their law firm is drafting changes to agreement as we speak.
mobile358	Just send the package to Kevin, we just need backup, not presentations.
mobile359	Rod,
mobile360	I am in Washington all week (until Friday) but may be available by phone.
mobile361	Can we go to 150/150 with Foster?
mobile362	I think Tim wants to move quickly.
mobile363	If Motley is in we are out of money.
mobile364	That's another hole in the NY trip.
mobile365	I'm on a vacation day but have to stop by the office later today and will round these up.
mobile366	Please let James and Kathy know.
mobile367	I want to thank everyone involved.
mobile368	Please feel free to call me on my cell at 713-302-5522 or at home at 713-218-7155 if you need to reach me urgently.
mobile369	Having said that, though, the underlying inventory items would have to be evaluated by the lenders for residual value and liquidity.
mobile370	What period does the max rate assumption cover?
mobile371	Chris
mobile372	Rod
mobile373	Never mind.
mobile374	There is a meeting in Omaha we are attending on Wednesday with Mary Kay and Dave.
mobile375	Probably bad luck.
mobile376	I'm open, though.
mobile377	I think you need to pay up for Foster - the lone marketer.
mobile378	Happy traveling.
mobile379	Forward it in to Steve for approval.
mobile380	Still views that Mark is out, Greg is temporary, and Stan is here for the company, for better or worse.
mobile381	Let me know if the plan is different.
mobile382	The price they paid recognized the debt was there, if it is not there, the price will be higher.
mobile383	Should be fine.
mobile384	See you then.
mobile385	Producers reacting to price management.
mobile386	Please see if you can find an 800 number for Lincoln Life Central for filing a life insurance claim.
mobile387	OK
mobile388	Kevin,
mobile389	Dave,
mobile390	I will be listening in for a little while.
mobile391	It has been very rough this week.
mobile392	I'll sign it in counterpart, then I'll find a fax somewhere and fax it back to you.
mobile393	Surely we can cover this from within Virgo's team?
mobile394	Leaving the in-laws.
mobile395	Just wanted to touch base.
mobile396	Not like you'll get paid for it.
mobile397	I am getting home early.
mobile398	I would suggest that we tweak the language in the third paragraph to say that we remain willing to provide feedback, instead of saying that we would like to.
mobile399	Thanks again for your help.
mobile400	The language needs to say that Enron has advised that it is willing to treat UBS as an affiliate.
mobile401	I'll be thinking of you.
mobile402	Has Brian had his contract yet?
mobile403	Regards,
mobile404	Could you try ringing her?
mobile405	What a crazy day.
mobile406	Did you set up a contract review session with Patton or any Dynegy folks for this AM?
mobile407	Right now its a pissing match between Watson and the banks.
mobile408	You didn't answer me about driving tomorrow.
mobile409	Do you need it today?
mobile410	I intend to distribute something this week.
mobile411	I thought you were on 6.
mobile412	Will call later to explain.
mobile413	Well that will be very similar to up here in the North Country!
mobile414	Joel will handle this.
mobile415	The contract is a bit complicated.
mobile416	Steve Gilbert is working on this.
mobile417	Sure
mobile418	Jim, can you stay point on this exercise for the ERCS and other items?
mobile419	I am scared by his approach of 120 days for interconnection and 60 for FERC.
mobile420	Hi there!
mobile421	No word yet from legal on rolling El Paso - ECP swaps back into ENA and arguing setoff rights to get our collateral back we are posting El Paso.
mobile422	There will be some better news later today
mobile423	What is going on?
mobile424	Playdate sounds great.
mobile425	Your kind thoughts are appreciated.
mobile426	Tax gave us the same feedback.
mobile427	It's easier to control money if we have the conversations.
mobile428	Make the move.
mobile429	Keep me posted!
mobile430	There are several business issues outstanding.
mobile431	I will be thinking of you.
mobile432	Let's have this meeting today/tonight.
mobile433	Who is this?
mobile434	John this message concerns me.
mobile435	Did we plan that?
mobile436	The pedicure needs to be with someone else so it's at the same time.
mobile437	This will make my week.
mobile438	I'm leaving around noon tomorrow to catch a flight.
mobile439	I am glad that things are going well.
mobile440	On Saturday Chad has a 3PM soccer game and a 5:30 birthday party.
mobile441	I already had Donna prepare a revised budget with people assigned directly to pipes and no cross pipe allocations.
mobile442	Need anything from Target?
mobile443	In the current environment, I am less than confident I could sell the unsecured Enron piece shortly.
mobile444	Lynn and Steve will attend for me.
mobile445	Given the prior understanding we had that this transaction did not require board approval, I do not think we can or should ask for that approval now.
mobile446	Do we need to meet before the meeting with SoCal?
mobile447	Any Messages?
mobile448	I will be late on day one.
mobile449	Chuck
mobile450	Assume for now that we are running identical trading books as it should be easy to cut the ones we do not want.
mobile451	Advice?
mobile452	I think I get this everyday now.
mobile453	Add it all up, we have a problem.
mobile454	Very nice.
mobile455	I forgot to send the address list before we left for Austin.
mobile456	Today has been hard for me.
mobile457	Let me know if I miss anything.
mobile458	I am trying to drive and email at the same time.
mobile459	Thanks.
mobile460	I'll probably page you.
mobile461	Couldn't risk the uncertainty.
mobile462	Elizabeth Brown will forward the capacity release data shortly.
mobile463	They do not want to count the 1.5B or the bank loans since they will simply increase the size of the notes.
mobile464	Call me to give me a heads up.
mobile465	FYI.
mobile466	These three letters, not one but three is very upsetting right before Christmas.
mobile467	And leave my school alone.
mobile468	I will investigate further this afternoon to see if there are any alternatives.
mobile469	I will be there.
mobile470	How was lunch?
mobile471	I am hanging in and hanging on, as is everyone else.
mobile472	Chris,
mobile473	No problem.
mobile474	If you are awaiting a visa and seconded to UBS - can you trade?
mobile475	Michelle
mobile476	We will have some good detail by January 7.
mobile477	I pray this is a huge oversight but yet I received three letters.
mobile478	Would you please send runner to get this?
mobile479	What is in the plan?
mobile480	I suspect someone will be doing the power stuff.
mobile481	Alina, Chad and I will meet you and Miss B tomorrow at 1:30 at T and C Starbucks.
mobile482	I have no idea.
mobile483	They said it was supposed to snow here.
mobile484	I'll get you details.
mobile485	Do you and George have a thing going?
mobile486	See you Monday.
mobile487	Besides Friday and Monday afternoons I don't have any other planned time off.
mobile488	If this has already been covered, then I apologize.
mobile489	Anything exciting going on today?
mobile490	I will approve the posting subject to the condition that it be internal only at this time.
mobile491	Budget allocation from Glisan has been postponed.
mobile492	He's ready and willing to be here any day we have something to discuss with him.
mobile493	She may have been told she had people but nobody had started.
mobile494	Even if the person never returns due to a conversion to LTD she wants us to pick up responsibility for those employees.
mobile495	The document has been signed and we do not have an out for our board.
mobile496	Will you and KB be around this afternoon?
mobile497	I'm looking forward to the long weekend!
mobile498	Do we need to do anything here?
mobile499	Could you resend?
mobile500	9:00 AM every second Saturday with Michelle.
mobile501	Bear in mind Umbrella had agreed to these terms and Mark M and Lance were to run them passed Top Gun.
mobile502	I won't be home until 6.
mobile503	Because there is traffic.
mobile504	I am fine with this.
mobile505	Kevin
mobile506	Jane, what about this Thursday for lunch?
mobile507	Call me ASAP.
mobile508	In other words let's make it look as binding as we can.
mobile509	I heard through the grapevine that El Paso had an emergency BOD meeting on Friday.
mobile510	I will check into your thoughts and get back to you.
mobile511	I also need the name of some apartments in London to stay in from Jill Whitehead.
mobile512	9:30 OK?
mobile513	I need to postpone our 4PM meeting as I want to go to the Cantor memorial service.
mobile514	I have been in contact with him, and he is familiar with the issues.
mobile515	Presumably so do you.
mobile516	Will 2PM ET work for you?
mobile517	I think, given that it's a liquid asset, it should be priced more like PRM activity than pure debt if it is to attract a capital charge.
mobile518	I know he has a lot going and doesn't have the crystal ball that I and others are looking for.
mobile519	What is happening to the stock price?
mobile520	Why aren't we using the lower CAPEX number with the lower rates?
mobile521	We have the data.
mobile522	Sorry.
mobile523	I'm working on family pictures for her - so a recent one of you guys would be great.
mobile524	Once you do, you can never go back.
mobile525	Call Bob Butts
mobile526	Should I bring you something back?
mobile527	NETCO.
mobile528	I'm stuck in traffic trying to get back from "ground zero".
mobile529	Dad
mobile530	Moved to the 7th.
mobile531	Shelley Leeds Rickets this AM.
mobile532	However, before we do anything, I need to see what you are proposing and visit with Rod.
mobile533	Where do I go for lunch?
mobile534	Let's discuss the charges.
mobile535	We need a copy of whatever they are looking at.
mobile536	And I can't turn my phone on.
mobile537	A letter is being sent today.
mobile538	I might have something at the office.
mobile539	Where do you want to meet to walk over there?
mobile540	How far is that (the airport they usually fly too) from downtown?
mobile541	Can you help with this one?
mobile542	Are things better for you at home tonight?
mobile543	We would disclose entities above TW in the Corp chain for informational purposes.
mobile544	Are you going to apply?
mobile545	They did.
mobile546	Mixed signals from APS today.
mobile547	Any news from Redmond?
mobile548	Will you call me or should I call you?
mobile549	Did you find Liz - if you did is she OK?
mobile550	Basically yes.
mobile551	Is it bad?
mobile552	Fran, yes please update.
mobile553	Let me know if it goes any lower.
mobile554	There is a marketing issue in relation to NNG procedures on monitoring stranger's gas.
mobile555	For TW.
mobile556	You should definitely stay engaged with KMI to see if we can do a deal.
mobile557	Good to know that the FERC cares!
mobile558	Presuming we can afford headcount?
mobile559	Milly is a seller.
mobile560	David
mobile561	I am almost speechless.
mobile562	I am not scheduled back until January 3.
mobile563	Ava, please put me on the list.
mobile564	Suggest you get facts before judging anyone.
mobile565	I am now officially a Blackberry addict.
mobile566	Have I mentioned how much I love Houston traffic?
mobile567	I would prefer that they have individual logins so we can audit who did what.
mobile568	877-382-9541 passcode 473270 to answer some of the questions, especially the CERA questions.
mobile569	Take what you can get.
mobile570	Love, Dad.
mobile571	Boy, I couldn't write too much on this thing!
mobile572	I have no documents on this transaction.
mobile573	FERC is interested for two reasons - to understand that TW operates separately from its marketing affiliate and as part of determining TW's capital structure and return in a rate case.
mobile574	Evidently, waiver was received but prohibits us from selling assets or prepaying debt without their approval.
mobile575	And yes I am learning how to use the Blackberry reasonably well.
mobile576	Should systems manage the migration?
mobile577	Yes, Belize is supposed to be very good also, but the island we would be going to is practically in Belize.
mobile578	Thanks again.
mobile579	Is Carol going back to swaps?
mobile580	I can't wait!
mobile581	Shelley (making good use of my jury duty time)
mobile582	Need before board meeting.
mobile583	Could be a range of things but he seems to be noting timing (maybe they are tapped out for cash).
mobile584	I would like to have a pedicure every 4 weeks at the same time as my manicure.
mobile585	I am going to go to work tomorrow, but I dread it.
mobile586	I think we should stick to customer figures rather than mix customer and contract stats.
mobile587	I've got a call into Bowen.
mobile588	I think that is the right answer.
mobile589	We've attached conditions to our commitment that I'd like to preserve.
mobile590	Next time ask Jim to call me.
mobile591	Target customers: Munis, Wapa, BPA.
mobile592	Can I meet with you at 4:00?
mobile593	I would think we could change to the new hotline almost immediately.
mobile594	No arrangements - he just hasn't had a good year.
mobile595	I copied the children's church materials yesterday and will have Gaby drop them off at church tomorrow.
mobile596	I'm glad you liked it.
mobile597	Thanks for all your support.
mobile598	We would really like some UBS signs for the trading floor - can we take the ones you have here?
mobile599	This looks fine.
mobile600	I am out of town on business.
mobile601	I've never worked with her.
mobile602	Get with Mary for format.
mobile603	Explain versus redo.
mobile604	I am sure you'll be back working in EEL before me.
mobile605	I hope you are feeling better.
mobile606	I will be in the office tomorrow.
mobile607	I'm glad she likes her tree.
mobile608	Are you getting all the information you need?
mobile609	Have a great trip.
mobile610	Lizzette.
mobile611	Tried reaching you earlier.
mobile612	My home number is 281 359-6258 if you need to reach me.
mobile613	FYI, I'll be on campus this Monday meeting with Tom Piazze and Donna Piazze at 3 and 4 PM and assisting with interviewing undergrads for Enron Tuesday, in case we need to discuss anything in person.
mobile614	Rick
mobile615	I would expect an answer ASAP.
mobile616	Going home to pack and then headed to Dallas.
mobile617	I think your outlined measures sound fine.
mobile618	What gives?
mobile619	Did you talk to Ava this morning?
mobile620	We have lots of paper stuff.
mobile621	We can discuss options early next week.
mobile622	Can you help?
mobile623	It's not looking too good is it?
mobile624	Has anyone else heard anything?
mobile625	I went to see a doctor.
mobile626	Ava, LA was Socal meeting.
mobile627	Sherri
mobile628	Hope you don't freeze tonight.
mobile629	I want to verify with litigation that the scope of the lawsuits regarding the El Paso swaps would preclude their inclusion in a master netting agreement.
mobile630	That is exactly what I would like you to do.
mobile631	We have beans, plus I will be cooking trash.
mobile632	Did you see Laura's message.?
mobile633	They did encourage us to do a deal with KMI.
mobile634	Donna Sheidun
mobile635	I'm in a board meeting sending you an email on my new Skytell pager.
mobile636	Is it over?
mobile637	You better be nice to me when I get back.
mobile638	I'll presume it is dead until I hear otherwise.
mobile639	Kathy,
mobile640	Going to New York tonight and will be home Tuesday night.
mobile641	I'll get you one.
mobile642	Seems unusual to me.
mobile643	OK with me.
mobile644	I just tracked down Steve.
mobile645	I love my Blackberry, but still getting used to typing on it.
mobile646	I thought it had gone to all of Enron.
mobile647	What will happen to this project?
mobile648	Just bought out Toys R Us.
mobile649	Mark Ellenberg is off for Passover.
mobile650	He was not aware of what was going on, and he wants to be advised before the money is paid.
mobile651	Conference call with partners on Tuesday.
mobile652	Are you not hearing back from my people on this?
mobile653	Jenny
mobile654	I saw your 5:30 AM message!
mobile655	I'm out at a seminar, but Joe Dilg is working on analysis.
mobile656	Although not a bunch of weekend work, this week has more than made up for it!
mobile657	Yes we need to get it in ASAP.
mobile658	I am snowed under and out of the office.
mobile659	I plan to be in the office tomorrow.
mobile660	Sincerely,
mobile661	I know it doesn't help much, but I'm not sure what you can tell everyone at this point.
mobile662	Press release issued.
mobile663	Both TW and NNG.
mobile664	I am unavailable for the 1PM meeting.
mobile665	Let me know.
mobile666	Is this because we have not rolled 2001 actuals in and thru 2002 plan?
mobile667	What a mess.
mobile668	EES and EEMC want to have the ability to pay more in advance (i.e., change the terms to allow us to not fall below three days in escrow rather than having to refresh on a daily basis).
mobile669	Louise,
mobile670	But it is quite powerful for communications and managing a group while traveling.
mobile671	I'll just have her call Tracy.
mobile672	Tim,
mobile673	Suspicion is approx 40% is due from ENA to ECC so it might get washed out in the consolidated EA reporting.
mobile674	I am looking forward to the salad.
mobile675	Could you make a doctor's appointment for tomorrow for the doctor on level 3?
mobile676	We're planning to go to West Virginia for Christmas.
mobile677	Happy Valentine's Day
mobile678	Is that EOTT or the company that owns it?
mobile679	Alaska?
mobile680	What's going on?
mobile681	You can talk to Becky!
mobile682	So I guess we'll have to check back in with Fran.
mobile683	Met with partners in San Francisco.
mobile684	I'm in a meeting but will check when I get back to my office.
mobile685	Daniel A. Muschar
mobile686	See you later,
mobile687	Wade
mobile688	I talked to Duran.
mobile689	We need to add the word energy to the 'UBS Warburg' on the top left hand corner of our screen.
mobile690	Dan
mobile691	But at this rate, I think that a vacation to NY and some shopping sounds like a better alternative.
mobile692	I'd send this to Sarah and Ryan for their database.
mobile693	I agreed terms with Greg.
mobile694	Michelle
mobile695	Going well here.
mobile696	I'll see what I can find out for you.
mobile697	What did you and Ava decide to do?
mobile698	I will talk with Jim Fallon and lawyers.
mobile699	I am at the lake.
mobile700	I wish he would leave Deerfield alone.
mobile701	Are you joining us for the 1:30 on Drew's office?
mobile702	I told you silly.
mobile703	I know it is our core business, but it might be quicker than selling Brazil.
mobile704	I had specifically taken this deal to Jeff for approval, and he had decided to not go forward at that point in time.
mobile705	All ideas welcome.
mobile706	Wednesday is definitely a hot chocolate day.
mobile707	Can you do the Gallup contracts as well?
mobile708	Apologize to Steve Dowd for me.
mobile709	Thanks for your concern.
mobile710	You're welcome.
mobile711	Mom
mobile712	Hillis set up a room if you would like to attend.
mobile713	Thursday works better for me.
mobile714	Unless you can think of a reason why not it makes it simpler, I think.
mobile715	Ahhh!
mobile716	Happy holidays.
mobile717	Will reveal as appropriate.
mobile718	One assistant and one HR associate.
mobile719	Joel Ephross on issues reacquiring economic interests/swaps from Jedi2/Whitewing.
mobile720	Use cell for next 40 minutes and then use home if you need me.
mobile721	Chase back office and their restart plan updates individually.
mobile722	Great.
mobile723	Lynn checked with Fran and she told her coordinator.
mobile724	FERC has not issued an order yet.
mobile725	Did we send the new version to K/M yet?
mobile726	Thanks,
mobile727	Thinks they would take a $30-$40mm P&L hit to liquidate SO2 position.
mobile728	I am all over it.
mobile729	I am on a plane, sorry.
mobile730	Has your 4th quarter changed?
mobile731	9 AM update meeting.
mobile732	Tomorrow is fine
mobile733	Depart after work on Friday 21 December and return on Sunday 30 December.
mobile734	I have not heard from anyone yet as to the expected transition time frame.
mobile735	Dave
mobile736	Any help?
mobile737	I guess that's additive to my stretch?
mobile738	Agreed!
mobile739	Pira thinks power suppliers in California should be worried about getting paid the long term contracts rates.
mobile740	Tim
mobile741	While I am out of the office today please keep Kevin Howard up to speed on what you see and hear.
mobile742	He especially loved the special kiss.
mobile743	Did you hear Alice quit?
mobile744	We received our INS approval today and will overnight thru notarized version to Ginger Monday.
mobile745	I think that we should enforce the agreement.
mobile746	Yes I did.
mobile747	Heading in to see Moody's.
mobile748	He's checking his email now and is expecting your call.
mobile749	I told you that you were a trouble maker!
mobile750	Out of office but have people working on info.
mobile751	Little value to the pipes.
mobile752	Just looking to gossip.
mobile753	Did he get a signing bonus?
mobile754	Would you two think about those who helped us so we can attempt to get some award to those who really helped us out here?
mobile755	Love it!
mobile756	What is the mood?
mobile757	Tracey is coming next weekend.
mobile758	Hi I'm in the board meeting but it shouldn't last much longer.
mobile759	I have some more data coming.
mobile760	I thought so.
mobile761	Still hustling to find dollars for the quarter end.
mobile762	Do we want to contest, if possible?
mobile763	Jim should call with a phone number so that I don't have to come over there.
mobile764	John Millar to report.
mobile765	Did Ginger give you any read on how long to translate our documents or when they might be sent to Kazakhstan?
mobile766	Sure was good talking to you this AM.
mobile767	I've been asked to provide a statement to Governor Knowles on Friday morning about Enron's situation and the effect on the Alaska project.
mobile768	Help yourself.
mobile769	Probably a Monday meeting of some of our marketing types to work on this one.
mobile770	The employee presentation talked about "trading and operations groups", the online materials talked about "trading staff and technology", the UBS spokesperson today in the news article said "625 traders and support people", and said the traders are "talking to customers about getting contracts in place".
mobile771	Never mind, I already deleted it.
mobile772	There is a meeting/conference call scheduled for tomorrow to go into details on these ERCS and determine how we spin them to the bank.
mobile773	I am out of office this week and will be unable to fill out questionnaire.
mobile774	John here is a note from Jane about some things marketing wants to talk about at our meeting.
mobile775	We can follow up in more detail later on the structure but we will also work on mitigating the margin required due to falling prices as the pipe deal closes and resources can be redeployed.
mobile776	When do you have to be there?
mobile777	All three.
mobile778	He says he has some ideas.
mobile779	Still not resolved.
mobile780	Try to survive!
mobile781	I hear Tim has huge problems.
mobile782	They are to execute the mandate letter by close of business today.
mobile783	We are about to leave Heaven!
mobile784	Rescinding is what you meant to say.
mobile785	I am on my way.
mobile786	Please leave it to Brian.
mobile787	Tom
mobile788	I sent you a message earlier today.
mobile789	I can't remember who sent it, and the ones I've reviewed don't have the info.
mobile790	I think that we got a good deal and you should not be getting dinged for that deal.
mobile791	I am continuing to handle some issues from home on KeySpan and some Florida contracts.
mobile792	Lynn, are you going to be able to attend the meeting?
mobile793	Can you get it from the price screen rather than the internet?
mobile794	Do we need to discuss?
mobile795	Bradford did not want to pursue this when we were doing the ring trades for AEP, but now it seems as though we should do it simply to raise cash.
mobile796	Shelly, just wanted to update you on a few things.
mobile797	Just playing with you!
mobile798	Shelley, I just found out this message did not go.
mobile799	It seems silly to have all of us going to Dave as he is the only EES person attending.
mobile800	I'm at the doctor's office, should be in later.
mobile801	A 13D filing is required.
mobile802	Tammie please forward to Duran.
mobile803	Looking for some gift hints from you.
mobile804	If we are not sure we can keep customers week to week why are we even doing this?
mobile805	Have a good trip.
mobile806	I haven't visited with Stan lately.
mobile807	They may want to discuss with you.
mobile808	I hope to have before the end of the day.
mobile809	Thank you.
mobile810	I suggested rather than buying assets from us (Alamac), he should be ready for us to ask him to co-invest alongside us if we need equity partners in transactions (BNY, Cogentrix, UAE, etc - didn't discuss any particular deals).
mobile811	What's your phone number?
mobile812	No, he is in fact commercial doing deals negotiating transactions of significant size, 2.5B this year alone.
mobile813	Neither Bowen, nor myself, know if any decision has been reached by the lenders at this time.
mobile814	Fine with me if you carry on and give me an assignment.
mobile815	Muller was going to send Vince the copy of the contract indicating the section to Vince that required the turnover just to make sure we were doing the right thing.
mobile816	I received word that the switch deal is off.
mobile817	Have you talked to Somerholder?
mobile818	Or if he comes down I-10N then?
mobile819	Do they start over or do they pick up where they left off?
mobile820	I would like to get a review with Stan and Jeff to decide.
mobile821	Thanks for checking with me.
mobile822	This is very sensitive.
mobile823	Let's take this up when Chris and I are in Houston.
mobile824	Can you please review and get back to Tim?
mobile825	Pie chart slide for AZ, NM, and NEV shows the source of info to be the "Arizona Corporation Commission".
mobile826	What is the stock price doing?
mobile827	Valeria.
mobile828	Kim will be out of the country on February 9.
mobile829	This financing shows up as minority interest.
mobile830	Thank you for your call.
mobile831	Can we have them until we move?
mobile832	Bummer.
mobile833	Please respond if anyone has a different view.
mobile834	On the plane, doors closing.
mobile835	What did Mark say?
mobile836	Lisa Mellencamp on any issues regarding pending litigation.
mobile837	I'll catch up with you tomorrow.
mobile838	Please refer to a map of Honduras (which shall be provided at a later date).
mobile839	Treasa knows the details.
mobile840	Are you in today?
mobile841	Have you done any deals yet?
mobile842	Actions
mobile843	Rick,
mobile844	What are you up to with Vince
mobile845	Talk to you tomorrow.
mobile846	I'm currently at the loading dock loading equipment for the hanger.
mobile847	Thanks!
mobile848	Thanks MHC
mobile849	Could you check on my appointment at Manos y Mas that I have a standing appointment every two weeks?
mobile850	We will be doing a conference call tomorrow AM at 10:00 our time with JP Morgan.
mobile851	Not in the near future.
mobile852	Others from my staff will attend and I'll catch up when I return.
mobile853	The meteor shower was incredible last night.
mobile854	Let me know where you might be.
mobile855	I'll review and send you a note over the weekend.
mobile856	Good to know it exists.
mobile857	80 plus percent of all of our trades are with those 50.
mobile858	Wasn't nearly as bad as I thought.
mobile859	Mitch
mobile860	Do you know anything?
mobile861	Thought?
mobile862	So no we didn't implement Skyline as proposed and nothing is pending.
mobile863	I will forward to Oxley to make him aware that there is something coming.
mobile864	They do have a 500 MW project in development near Las Vegas, which may present an opportunity.
mobile865	I am assuming Elizabeth will be in to help me?
mobile866	I'll let you know when I figure it out!
mobile867	I think that Pam Butler called him.
mobile868	Would you mind doing the following?
mobile869	We need to come home, Lynda is about to break me.
mobile870	How are you doing with Sierra Pacific - I really need it?
mobile871	Dallas and I am not coming back!
mobile872	Can you get me detail then on the capital for the 2 years?
mobile873	Sure.
mobile874	I have my cell phone and my Blackberry so I can get email.
mobile875	Not yet
mobile876	I didn't read it all but assume it is OK.
mobile877	I'll come have a beer with you guys later.
mobile878	The SoCal meeting was very beneficial.
mobile879	I'd be hesitant to show panic that we must sell the asset at any price prior to September 30 and trade real economic value and negotiate from a weaker position when we can have a clean sale two weeks later (ideally before 3Q earnings release).
mobile880	Selling Wessex is the right move for everyone.
mobile881	Have a great evening!
mobile882	But I believe answer will be yes.
mobile883	TW of course.
mobile884	Let it rip.
mobile885	I just sent Alice an email asking for help finding a number for Dad's life insurance company.
mobile886	While it was very scary for Helen, I'm satisfied with Randy's reply.
mobile887	Hush
mobile888	I think we do need to discuss contracts for both of them and find the money for them.
mobile889	Sorry missed this one - David this was done wasn't it?
mobile890	What is our gross margin per MMBTU for 2001?
mobile891	We just need a sitter.
mobile892	I will leave my Blackberry on.
mobile893	We must be consistent.
mobile894	Great job
mobile895	Did you tell Steve?
mobile896	She has absolutely everything.
mobile897	On the other deal, they are back to total capital expenditures and not just expansion dollars.
mobile898	I wonder if RBS is another institution which could move quickly.
mobile899	Is this the conference rate?
mobile900	If we really can't do above let's say so and we can look at plan b.
mobile901	When things get speculative the language always gets scary.
mobile902	I'm not planning on doing anything this week.
mobile903	Thanks for taking the lead on this.
mobile904	Kay Mann is going to take the lead on this.
mobile905	This is a most unfortunate news release.
mobile906	She just came.
mobile907	This is good I think.
mobile908	It is not surprising.
mobile909	They will be getting new results over the weekend and it should be indicative of trends.
mobile910	Let me know how I can help.
mobile911	Please send to Gary Smith.
mobile912	We can have wine and catch up.
mobile913	An increase in the fee for this substantial change of the deal is market.
mobile914	Kim
mobile915	My Blackberry did not pick up the email you were responding to.
mobile916	Also know that I won't be talking to Jeff until next week.
mobile917	We plan on reviewing with Stan on Monday.
mobile918	You just can't work without me can you?
mobile919	Don't they have some conflicts here?
mobile920	L M
mobile921	On my way down.
mobile922	Suzanne emailed me that Randi Thompson, the head of Kidsave, is in Kazakstan right now and will be sending out an email to the Kidsave families.
mobile923	Please pass along my thanks, though.
mobile924	Obviously we shouldn't bother with Bridgeline, peoples or anything like that.
mobile925	Today we're going to an Astros practice and then we catch our flight home.
mobile926	Can you get me the Calger letter done?
mobile927	I am getting the feeling that these messages don't get through.
mobile928	No sign of Chuck and not responding to messages.
mobile929	Twanda would you please call Joe Dilg and ask him when he will have his analysis of Diomedes' issues completed?
mobile930	I had a long meeting with their chief credit officer from London yesterday and he agreed to put someone here from day one capable of making decisions.
mobile931	We have suspended our neutral reference practice in light of the layoffs yesterday.
mobile932	The invites for the credit and legal meetings were called "trader meetings".
mobile933	BBB+/BBB- issue needs another follow up today and hopefully can be put away.
mobile934	JT
mobile935	They are firmly sitting on the fence.
mobile936	Happy Holidays to you and your staff.
mobile937	Thanks for note.
mobile938	Her in laws won't be there, but friends will be.
mobile939	Can't use my parents because they'll be at Lisa Bowman's wedding.
mobile940	We wanted to maintain a recurring 1.5M and since ad valorem will decrease as a function of depreciation we thought the way to maintain the constant we increase the 650K at the same rate as the depreciation.
mobile941	Hi Alice.
mobile942	What is our cash needs over the week to ten days?
mobile943	Thanks for your leadership on this issue.
mobile944	Is this a standard language?
mobile945	Chase waiting to issue press release stating ENE has received the amendment and that we have closed and funded our NNG deal.
mobile946	Tony, please print and send 12 copies up to 50 ASAP.
mobile947	I'm on a conference call.
mobile948	Probably need additional review by someone now, given the current situation.
mobile949	I will call Gary and Fran on Wednesday hope that they are in the office and can assist me.
mobile950	No need to send to FL.
mobile951	No obligation to pay.
mobile952	I talked to Peggy last night, and we are on for Christmas dinner with them.
mobile953	What does Hunter think?
mobile954	I think CSFB was aware of that on the euro prepay.
mobile955	Money wise that is.
mobile956	Will let you know how call goes in morning.
mobile957	Gracias,
mobile958	He is at 281 350 8441.
mobile959	No offer.
mobile960	Just so you know, I'm still in the waiting room.
mobile961	Can you get me an estimate of how much cash margin we are still holding that might get converted to LC's?
mobile962	Trip was good I presume?
mobile963	What is wrong?
mobile964	I am getting back early around 4:30.
mobile965	Also can you make sure Sue and Kent have seen it?
mobile966	That was so sweet.
mobile967	Anxious to hear how the paging worked for you.
mobile968	As I am out if you need anything please contact Oxley directly.
mobile969	Stress!
mobile970	Were those the only 2 changes?
mobile971	Marisa sent the invoices.
mobile972	We need to bring them along slowly.
mobile973	Just got this.
mobile974	Get with David Lund.
mobile975	Heading to Toronto to see family - my brother is home from Japan.
mobile976	Weather is bad here.
mobile977	Long and boring story - at about 12 we got those administrators but there were no numbers in them - zeros.
mobile978	I have asked Lizzette to look at this for you.
mobile979	Where are you?
mobile980	In a meeting with your guys now.
mobile981	That is fine, but I do have to get Cameron today, so let Shanna know.
mobile982	I am up with Stan if you need me.
mobile983	I'll try to sit down with him next week.
mobile984	The desire, however, is related to the possibility of spending a fair amount of time in diving locations during my honeymoon.
mobile985	How long can you guys shop?
mobile986	He will be available via phone.
mobile987	Is Terry pulling his hair out yet?
mobile988	Glad you weren't in an accident today.
mobile989	Steve Harris usually has some good stuff from budget presentations.
mobile990	Can't we identify the impacts of the non NNG stuff in the financials?
mobile991	Thanks for your kind words.
mobile992	I am still hearing rumors about an involuntary by Haynes and Boone.
mobile993	Considering what?
mobile994	For what reimbursement?
mobile995	Joe and Henry - could you please do the same with Andrew?
mobile996	Since this is the first time we received this form I just wanted to confirm.
mobile997	I need you to consolidate into one schedule for TW.
mobile998	Talk to you later.
mobile999	I can't recall if we put any provision on that issue in the bid template or not.
mobile1000	I have tried my best over the years to improve deal quality to an audience that usually told me that I was irrelevant.
mobile1001	Help
mobile1002	Thanks good job.
mobile1003	Hopefully this can wait until Monday.
mobile1004	David and I sent them back - it doesn't change the numbers.
mobile1005	I'm fully recovered and back on pace.
mobile1006	I'm volunteering at school this afternoon and can't open the attachment on my Blackberry.
mobile1007	I am not concerned with the Brown money.
mobile1008	I'm planning to drive back today, and will take tomorrow off.
mobile1009	Generally he doesn't like these but I am OK if Teresa wants to let them.
mobile1010	I'll be somewhere between Pueblo and the Royal Gorge, but I'll try to stop and patch in.
mobile1011	No employment claims for gas or power.
mobile1012	Cash is king for now and we need the pricing to get the rest of the cash.
mobile1013	I still would like to discuss status of the program when you are available.
mobile1014	We should change all references to say top 10 customers provide 66 percent of revenues.
mobile1015	On my way back.
mobile1016	We can work around these plans if you prefer.
mobile1017	I met with Dave Duran yesterday to get his signature.
mobile1018	I am freaking out!
mobile1019	Love, Judy.
mobile1020	Thanks, Suz.
mobile1021	Maybe you can leave early.
mobile1022	Help!
mobile1023	I can either plant this Saturday or next.
mobile1024	It's fine.
mobile1025	What happened with Brent Price?
mobile1026	Will be a while.
mobile1027	I expect that NNG will make a new proposal to reflect peak cost responsibility as part of the next rate case.
mobile1028	Why do you ask?
mobile1029	However, I do not feel that the accounts for the resources should be disabled.
mobile1030	As you can see not everybody is always on board.
mobile1031	Don't forget to pray.
mobile1032	Is this in addition to the one with Dan at 1:30?
mobile1033	OK I asked Gary to have you decide on Michael.
mobile1034	Quick updates: spoke with Larry lawyer at EGM.
mobile1035	Nothing important.
mobile1036	I haven't asked Hunter - let's discuss in the morning.
mobile1037	There are a couple of slides in the recent bank package NNG prepared and a few more slides in the original 2002 budget package.
mobile1038	I love you too.
mobile1039	Kevin Howard will not be able to accompany us to Phoenix.
mobile1040	Ava, please be sure Tuesday afternoon is blocked for me to spend with the teams.
mobile1041	Just told them I thought it would be impossible.
mobile1042	Just kidding.
mobile1043	Mahonia transaction is one way margin only because Mahonia has already prepaid their leg of the transaction so there is never a scenario where the floating leg would be less than the fixed leg (which has been bought down to 0) so margining is not possible in that direction.
mobile1044	Mike, are you aware of this?
mobile1045	I am assuming from this that you are in - which is great news.
mobile1046	Rosco was great.
mobile1047	I'd be happy to.
mobile1048	Walking in
mobile1049	This looks fine with me.
mobile1050	So how many times can people ask me if I am going to get let go this holiday?
mobile1051	Does the state have copies of all programs?
mobile1052	My focus is on possibly dislodging money for Orlando.
mobile1053	Jeff
mobile1054	She has a web address.
mobile1055	You have a lot of holes in your plan.
mobile1056	MAG
mobile1057	I agree since I am at the bank right now.
mobile1058	Did you not read my first email?
mobile1059	I was planning to attend.
mobile1060	That would be great.
mobile1061	Fannin is a mess by the Dome and elsewhere.
mobile1062	Sheila
mobile1063	Thank you for your prompt reply.
mobile1064	He is leading the effort in our areas during this time of stress/crisis for me.
mobile1065	I just want to make sure Louise has the best data points for making a decision on my proposal of this morning.
mobile1066	Great
mobile1067	Can you wait until Monday?
mobile1068	Carol.
mobile1069	Tied St Jerome 1 to 1.
mobile1070	Can you help me here?
mobile1071	I know several who work there.
mobile1072	I changed that in one prior draft.
mobile1073	TXU is off everyone else OK.
mobile1074	I would like these as soon as possible and you can email to the CC addresses as well.
mobile1075	Probably will be working.
mobile1076	Given that the new structure requires a new market, new rating agency process and new documentation, we are effectively documenting and selling a new second transaction.
mobile1077	See you in Enron House when I get back.
mobile1078	What is the cost issue?
mobile1079	I will resend to you.
mobile1080	Please send me an email.
mobile1081	I will circle back with everyone later today.
mobile1082	What a jerk.
mobile1083	The amount of information we get is even worse as Fred usually calls with updates and since you know nothing - we know less.
mobile1084	Banks want to exclude goodwill.
mobile1085	So I have an appointment every two weeks going forward for manicure and a pedicure every 4 weeks.
mobile1086	If you can obtain an unconditional commitment from APS, go for it.
mobile1087	Here's my work email (kay.mann@enron.com).
mobile1088	We are trying to get all issues resolved as quickly as possible.
mobile1089	I can fill you in later but there is no financeable value to the ERCS.
mobile1090	Don't make me pull tapes on whether you understood our fee.
mobile1091	Let's discuss.
mobile1092	I will review with marketing and the team when I get back.
mobile1093	Is that enough for this week?
mobile1094	Probably won't have anything to tell late tonight.
mobile1095	Yes I will be back tonight.
mobile1096	I think I feel better, but I would like some comfort from the lawyer in the crew.
mobile1097	Got your note.
mobile1098	I can look at it tonight.
mobile1099	It was a heroic effort on a very difficult and unusual financing.
mobile1100	I'll try.
mobile1101	We should be in a good negotiating position.
mobile1102	I'm in a meeting until noon.
mobile1103	Don't know how that happened.
mobile1104	You snooze you lose!
mobile1105	I'll call you to set up a time.
mobile1106	Thanks for all you are doing
mobile1107	You might forward the email to Ben, I think Pompano has a queue spot.
mobile1108	Sorry but I'm hostage in meeting in 39c1.
mobile1109	There is a God.
mobile1110	Team is Bradford and Carol St Clair on master netting agreement.
mobile1111	If she isn't in for some reason, I'll ask for your help.
mobile1112	Are you OK?
mobile1113	Might include proposals with respect to Alaska.
mobile1114	Would you please check to see that VBS is penciled in July 22-26 on the church calendar.
mobile1115	If not, Julie and I will track them down this afternoon.
mobile1116	Nothing for Paige.
mobile1117	Please send it to both of us.
mobile1118	I will if I want to.
mobile1119	Mike McGowan in Omaha would be the only one who might know.
mobile1120	Issue on post bankruptcy price risk issue remains.
mobile1121	Barclays will be back tomorrow on whether they can proceed with rolling the existing SO2 credits and at what price.
mobile1122	Jan, sorry for the inconvenience.
mobile1123	And, if you want she could use a photo album or scrapbook for her story.
mobile1124	Told him we'd expect him to turn the deals quickly.
mobile1125	We are on a plane coming back.
mobile1126	M
mobile1127	Finally, I would delete the paragraph about lawyers.
mobile1128	Also, regarding the cash flow from Canada.
mobile1129	I am sorry you had to come in.
mobile1130	David - did it go out?
mobile1131	That is one of the things we are working on.
mobile1132	Previously he had left it up to Jeff who had said no.
mobile1133	Hey
mobile1134	Only as a last resort should we want to redo.
mobile1135	I got it, pal.
mobile1136	My mobile number is 7134080929.
mobile1137	I'm out today, so don't wait on me to file.
mobile1138	Dave,
mobile1139	But, we typically send a PDF file that contains all of our info by email.
mobile1140	Ben could tell him about Pompano.
mobile1141	I think this just happened Friday.
mobile1142	If you need a signature fax it to the hotel.
mobile1143	What Enron entity owns the EOTT GP?
mobile1144	The dial in network is down so Elizabeth is headed into the office to get the PGE capacity release report.
mobile1145	I agree with Morris
mobile1146	I think we should put a number on the table.
mobile1147	I'm walking lenders through ENA on/off BS debt and why majority is not, and must not, be considered Enron recourse for sizing additional leverage.
mobile1148	Given Gary's presentation on bonus timing I plan to turn in my recommendation today.
mobile1149	Tell everyone to calm down and get their work done.
mobile1150	Let me know when you get this.
mobile1151	I wanted to go drinking with you.
mobile1152	Trader Support Group
mobile1153	Aloha!
mobile1154	Jordan is taking Christina Mordant's last job, corporate development.
mobile1155	BCollins@NYMEX.com
mobile1156	It is rough still - but looks like we can stay within budget for each pipe.
mobile1157	I will make meatloaf for dinner when I get home.
mobile1158	No material impact.
mobile1159	Dan wanted to tell you that there is leftover potato casserole on the top shelf of the fridge.
mobile1160	We don't seem to have any positive income there.
mobile1161	I will be back Friday.
mobile1162	Would you mind getting with Diane on the issue of online harassment prevention training?
mobile1163	Love to all, Kay.
mobile1164	I also want to update liquidity with some comments about LCs and refinancing requirements including Rawhide, Bank RC, Marlin and Osprey.
mobile1165	We have lots of forks, etc. (went to Sam's).
mobile1166	Jim:
mobile1167	Gary I will call you when I get back in the office.
mobile1168	Two days when?
mobile1169	Thanks
mobile1170	Very cute.
mobile1171	Things are OK.
mobile1172	Please make sure Bob Kelley is on the list.
mobile1173	The comment that troubles me more is that we are fully contracted West thru 2005.
mobile1174	Michael was great this AM.
mobile1175	Can you send me an invitation for the two meetings on Monday in Outlook?
mobile1176	I think it's over now.
mobile1177	Gary made it sound like you had decided to lose Michael.
mobile1178	It's not working very well.
mobile1179	I'm not familiar with the individual assets (might include gaspart and CEG/RIO) of that structure but the critical asset apparently is a $690mm loan to Enron.
mobile1180	I think that is right, but I do not have the data to confirm that.
mobile1181	Get then to ring Greg if necessary - I really want to be able to tell people I've signed.
mobile1182	I agree with Jim.
mobile1183	I trust that everyone already understands what is contracted and the only concern is our recontracting capability.
mobile1184	I need your home cell or whatever.
mobile1185	Still planning it - it might be just worth joining by phone to check the state of play.
mobile1186	Mike, I'm afraid I have a conflict in San Diego on behalf of Ken Lay those days.
mobile1187	Let him pursue his claims with everyone else.
mobile1188	There is an article about the legal department.
mobile1189	We are in 49C1.
mobile1190	If all goes well, I think we can be done by mid October.
mobile1191	How completely horrible.
mobile1192	If not can I call you?
mobile1193	There are approximately 50 counterparties that we want to hit in the first week of business.
mobile1194	We are still in Palacios, having a quiet AM.
mobile1195	As prices fall we effectively begin to repay the transaction.
mobile1196	No to both.
mobile1197	She is a Baylor graduate and is very nice.
mobile1198	Without the language on assignment in the LC, if you move the underlying trades to a permitted affiliate, the LC would not follow.
mobile1199	We've already eliminated his speech therapy.
mobile1200	But I would like a waiver, so I think we should consider some sort of payment.
mobile1201	FYI on the demand letter I signed earlier.
mobile1202	Ava please put on my calendar.
mobile1203	Then there is adoption stuff and then there is world news.
mobile1204	I also just received my Blackberry, cool.
mobile1205	I have Alina at the doctor for her physical this afternoon, but we should be home by 6 PM and be home all evening.
mobile1206	Confirmed with Mark Taylor.
mobile1207	I am really hoping that you will have some time to be my therapist this weekend.
mobile1208	Yes, plus the ability to grow or to keep the IT PNR and other revenue.
mobile1209	In fact I think we were going to move everyone into ENA and have them hired by NetCo after closing.
mobile1210	Do you still need me to sign something?
mobile1211	Good morning.
mobile1212	Steve,
mobile1213	So does this mean Mimi's email is up and running?
mobile1214	If we want to sell then we need to file and wait.
mobile1215	I have a quick meeting with legal on interpreting the contract ambiguity regarding curtailment this morning and can fill you in on all those discussions shortly.
mobile1216	Not yet.
mobile1217	I will be checking up with Lisa.
mobile1218	I will likely not be available.
mobile1219	Fran is trying to get with McMahon to get his take on them.
mobile1220	I'm on 6.
mobile1221	And also can you start planning to have infinity up and running on day one?
mobile1222	Frank
mobile1223	Do you have (or Bob) copies of NNG's debt agreements, current?
mobile1224	Had conference calls with Godfrey, Lamb and Mitchell on Indian Mesa 2.
mobile1225	The issue is that in order to sell the units there is a public disclosure of the units being in rawhide which may have some more issues.
mobile1226	Still waiting on decision.
mobile1227	All I need is for you to prepare a one sentence description of the set off deal.
mobile1228	I gather you heard about 6 to 7 for Cornhusker for this quarter.
mobile1229	What happened?
mobile1230	I still get 7-8 people every day whining about the "trading vs. marketing thing".
mobile1231	I'll meet you at Bill Sperry's office at 12:30.
mobile1232	It is probably a good idea to go and stay downtown.
mobile1233	I love you.
mobile1234	Got here early.
mobile1235	It consists of rocks he has picked up at the park and a few gems he bought at a museum.
mobile1236	Knock yourself out.
mobile1237	We are working on it but in the grand scheme of things it is kind of a back burner issue.
mobile1238	How can we get these answers?
mobile1239	I am trying to get a decision, but I think we need to maintain flexibility, if at all possible.
mobile1240	You hang in there too.
mobile1241	I received three letters stating that since I am no longer with Enron I can access and move my savings plan.
mobile1242	Got your message.
mobile1243	What's your proposal?
mobile1244	Can we meet at 3:30?
mobile1245	Chuck's numbers he walked you through earlier assumed 100 BPS in fees so we are slightly better than forecast.
mobile1246	6:15 and still going but should be done by 6:30.
mobile1247	Both of us are still here.
mobile1248	Developing valuation methodology for ETS interest Sun Devil.
mobile1249	Did you send out a global message from me?
mobile1250	Chuck Ward
mobile1251	Not even in yet.
mobile1252	Barry, hope that you had a great Christmas.
mobile1253	I am still uncomfortable doing anything with NNG's swaps until someone can tell me who the swaps are with, who the confirms are with, what underlying contracts are being terminated, and what are the ramifications of the termination.
mobile1254	I will.
mobile1255	MOU signed
mobile1256	I don't want to let my nanny go home if you think you need me.
mobile1257	See you then
mobile1258	The rest is a byproduct of slapshot.
mobile1259	Heightened state of awareness down there with the flow of info.
mobile1260	Disney was great and I've been to eight baseball games.
mobile1261	Still, I'm always up for opera.
mobile1262	Just so you know John Arnold asked me this morning about individuals on EOL.
mobile1263	Ava, please put on my calendar.
mobile1264	We will keep trying.
mobile1265	Much better than carrying a laptop.
mobile1266	I know a live plant is risky, but I figured people buy cut trees and stick them in water, so what the heck.
mobile1267	Any interest in chatting about a job at UBS?
mobile1268	Email the consent to me.
mobile1269	I spoke with GP benefits counsel this morning.
mobile1270	1 - number of questions on this.
mobile1271	How soon do you need it?
mobile1272	I think what you are proposing should be fine but it would help to understand the background.
mobile1273	How are things with you?
mobile1274	Yep
mobile1275	Michael said his day was rotten.
mobile1276	Dan Boyle mentioned that today is the deadline for the Rawhide amendment.
mobile1277	Nothing but good news everyday.
mobile1278	Not good really for me as I was finally hoping to get paid this year.
mobile1279	Eric Boyt is pulling deal numbers and details to match to documents.
mobile1280	Sent to 8
mobile1281	Message is getting through.
mobile1282	Mary Jean.
mobile1283	John, can you give Konni a call?
mobile1284	Sarah.
mobile1285	I left a message.
mobile1286	I want per MMBTU.
mobile1287	Rod Hayslett
mobile1288	Kevin needs to bird dog the folks we met with today.
mobile1289	I guess this is OK if you are.
mobile1290	I am not aware of any.
mobile1291	Can you get my contract ready for me to sign tomorrow at 2PM?
mobile1292	$2.75B and counting.
mobile1293	Perhaps there was a glitch.
mobile1294	I am going to start preparing documents to terminate our involvement with AIG.
mobile1295	Thinks PWR suppliers in California should be worried about getting paid the long term contracts rates.
mobile1296	Also hope you can make sense of this email.
mobile1297	I hope to provide you with a more detailed answer after consulting reliable travel guides and weather almanacs.
mobile1298	It would be similar to having the BOD of Enron turning down a project with Frevert, Kitchen and Duran support with a signed dash.
mobile1299	What number should he call you on?
mobile1300	We are proceeding with a great reception so far.
mobile1301	You can reply via email.
mobile1302	I'll find someone to do it.
mobile1303	Ray
mobile1304	There was a rawhide bankers meeting late yesterday to consider Enron's request to delay the call by several weeks.
mobile1305	Geez, I sound pathetic.
mobile1306	If we agreed to do so, then our records should reflect that service date.
mobile1307	Will do
mobile1308	Happy Thanksgiving.
mobile1309	I have the cable now if you are still here.
mobile1310	We will need to allocate individual seats early next week.
mobile1311	Pat and I talked about TW concerns.
mobile1312	We haven't sold the US business as yet.
mobile1313	I would like to discuss.
mobile1314	I'm so excited.
mobile1315	I would like it paid through I Buy It.
mobile1316	Just heads - I am sending out a more detailed update to the larger group later today.
mobile1317	I do not believe that we are in violation of any transfer restrictions.
mobile1318	I think these will be just fine.
mobile1319	Dave
mobile1320	Ava, do we need to worry about this?
mobile1321	Mitch
mobile1322	Mike,
mobile1323	What happened to Savita?
mobile1324	Are you feeling better?
mobile1325	You have a nice holiday too.
mobile1326	Thanks see you at 4.
mobile1327	Kvisle is not current on our consortium's plans to pitch a 4.5 BCF/D pipeline.
mobile1328	I would be worried if my son was walking around in women's shoes!
mobile1329	We need to talk about this month.
mobile1330	How is it going?
mobile1331	Any questions about these items and you can typically get the quickest estimate or actual from me.
mobile1332	Contact me tomorrow at 3032788492 prior to emailing me the document as discussed below.
mobile1333	You probably do that too when no one's around!
mobile1334	I will be there in 5 minutes.
mobile1335	What about Jay?
mobile1336	Milnthorp and I are getting input from the various desks - we have "national accounts", large regionals and customers.
mobile1337	I'm here.
mobile1338	What happened to the guy with the paper to sign?
mobile1339	I tried that to no avail.
mobile1340	Talk to TK but I think these will be fine.
mobile1341	That's not the behavior that I was looking for.
mobile1342	I was trying to remember what Bobby said.
mobile1343	I'm quite interested as I told Lyn.
mobile1344	Either we call every commercial person a trader or we periodically acknowledge the existence of marketers.
mobile1345	Also, the last sentence of that paragraph should ask whether she would like to pursue that option instead of asking about her availability.
mobile1346	Wes's team is comparing ECC's projected financials to what was included for ECC in the current estimate.
mobile1347	Maybe stuff we do more of next year.
mobile1348	I'll see if we can incorporate some of this in the changes we are proposing.
mobile1349	How do you like the Blackberry?
mobile1350	We are waiting on the cold front.
mobile1351	John Keffer is the one I know best.
mobile1352	Tomorrow morning!
mobile1353	Okay
mobile1354	I have a direct recommendation from my travel obsessed friend, Jessica, who just got certified there a couple months ago and has provided me with both information and endorsements.
mobile1355	Storage doesn't fit any of the capital pricing scenarios we have laid out - balance sheet, PRM, or off balance sheet.
mobile1356	Ken agreed yesterday.
mobile1357	Neil has been asking around.
mobile1358	We are having fun.
mobile1359	Stan
mobile1360	I have rates and capacity utilization information ready.

mobile1405	As you know, it isn't easy.
mobile1406	Congrats big time.
mobile1407	Amanda day.
mobile1408	I assume that you are working with Terrie James on this.
mobile1409	Yup he can do it by phone.
mobile1410	This is fun!
mobile1411	Have to be careful that you don't lose historical data for rate purposes.
mobile1412	Brief discussion on noise in the market he's hearing and reading, etc.
mobile1413	Please forward to Kevin Howard.
mobile1414	See you soon,
mobile1415	Isn't that about the way it could happen?
mobile1416	Thanks for the plant.
mobile1417	I'm just pulling in to the garage and will call back in a minute.
mobile1418	This is not a ying-yang issue: I am thrilled about this deal closing, but we need to fix this or else we will have a nonproductive group of expensive personnel.
mobile1419	Are you two talking?
mobile1420	Honduras.
mobile1421	Shelley,
mobile1422	Fran, the latest on GP closing is November 15 as a target, but the 30th is more likely.
mobile1423	The answer depends, so we need to be careful about how we answer it.

mobile1425	Go to 16.
mobile1426	Ta ta,
mobile1427	Go ahead and turn the next draft with Pinnacle West, too.
mobile1428	I understand that while Bowen signed draw requests on Thursday, legal had OK'd.
mobile1429	Can you remember?
mobile1430	I compliment you?
mobile1431	Every day there is something new, different, and bad about us.
mobile1432	If ENA doesn't provide security, we need to be in a position to step in.
mobile1433	Are you available?
mobile1434	The neat thing is that you use you're regular cell number.
mobile1435	Let's wait until Monday.
mobile1436	Lynn
mobile1437	OK.
mobile1438	We have been on the go all day and it has been after business hours when I've gotten back to the house so I didn't get to talk to you.
mobile1439	Are you on the diet with me?
mobile1440	That would likely be an expensive option.
mobile1441	We haven't made that decision here though.
mobile1442	Good for you.
mobile1443	I decided that I am going to stay here!
mobile1444	I have forwarded to Kelly.
mobile1445	I think that we are already well underway on TW's Red Rock and were not expecting to use external capital for.
mobile1446	I have a meeting on Tuesday from 1-4 with Stan.
mobile1447	Only one possible variance from what we had previously heard.

mobile1449	Why?
mobile1450	Any chance of doing the one penny test with the credit departments of the top couple of customers?

mobile1452	Louise, I am out on January 2 and returning on the third.
mobile1453	Have a great day!
mobile1454	You haven't seen 120 in some time.
mobile1455	Email me at tcsjws@aol.com.
mobile1456	Cool!
mobile1457	Lavo called it, never mind though.
mobile1458	I don't think we need to make a big deal of this.
mobile1459	The replacement would need to fly to Philadelphia Monday night and would get back late on Tuesday night.

mobile1465	Would you have John send me a message?
mobile1466	I would like to make sure we know the definition per group.
mobile1467	I've been in with Kaminski and Bowen all morning so I have limited feedback today.
mobile1468	Not sure I mentioned this: Kerrigan's now running non-regulated finance side at TXU in Dallas.
mobile1469	Thanks Dan, we'll look after him.
mobile1470	Wonder what next week will bring.
mobile1471	Hope that you have a great TG.
mobile1472	Julie,
mobile1473	How are things?
mobile1474	Happy to help you guys anyways (I know you'll thank me later).
mobile1475	Can you talk to the appropriate commercial people and get them to decide?
mobile1476	Ruth,
mobile1477	They are ranked by volume and include type of contract, entity name, credit limits, etc.
mobile1478	I'll call later.
mobile1479	If you need me to call tonight leave me an email or phone mail and I will call when I get in.
mobile1480	Room 1716
mobile1481	What would you think about trying to coordinate hair appointments on Saturday?
mobile1482	Chad would like to go to Zainy Brainy and I need to exchange some things at Gymboree.
mobile1483	So you're ignoring me.
mobile1484	I think I'm OK.
mobile1485	Could you print theirs and ours for me since I may not make it to my desk before I come over?
mobile1486	Where are they hitting the books at?
mobile1487	Your voice cheered me up.
mobile1488	They're not having the baby then.
mobile1489	Meeting with Alaska Governor Tony Knowles on November 30th.
mobile1490	Too tiny!
mobile1491	How about a call today at 2?
mobile1492	Today, I understand legal is less comfortable.
mobile1493	Coal switching to NG and power guys stimulating demand.
mobile1494	I'm back.
mobile1495	Kay
mobile1496	I think there are three deals.
mobile1497	Have a Happy Thanksgiving.
mobile1498	We will keep you posted.
mobile1499	To reach a September 30 closing, I think the only option would be to ask bank of America to underwrite and buy the whole thing.
mobile1500	I am really not wanting to come back.
mobile1501	Like the ideas, I'll be in tomorrow, let's chat then.
mobile1502	Do we have anyone in Portland?
mobile1503	No surprise there.
mobile1504	I spoke with Lara Robinson this morning.
mobile1505	Chip Schneider makes that call.
mobile1506	If not, I can try information in Omaha.
mobile1507	OK I thought it was in Washington state.
mobile1508	It went well.
mobile1509	We are sitting in Weil's offices, waiting to negotiate.
mobile1510	Tracy and Jim are trying to track down six more copies.
mobile1511	Pre April 1997 was specifically not covered by the 6 month rule.
mobile1512	Will get back to you.
mobile1513	I am on Blackberry and missed the end of the talking points.
mobile1514	We will make some minor changes at the hanger but we will leave it up and ready to go.
mobile1515	Hope you guys are doing fine.
mobile1516	Are you going to call?
mobile1517	Did that happen?
mobile1518	In my car on the way to the office from the airport.
mobile1519	$67M within 10 trading days.
mobile1520	I hope you went.
mobile1521	They have to go away and have a think.
mobile1522	I just found a sympathy card from Karen Heathman in my briefcase.
mobile1523	Has it been mentioned yet?
mobile1524	Did we take the money against this from the NYMEX swap?
mobile1525	Kelly Ferrari will have the name of a chauffeur company.
mobile1526	Well I guess from what is taking place that Dynegy has backed out of the deal.
mobile1527	I want to get all of that stuff cleaned up.
mobile1528	Hi.
mobile1529	We will address tomorrow with Stan.
mobile1530	I would be glad to participate.
mobile1531	Are Linde and Kim available to assist Rod?
mobile1532	Back at you.
mobile1533	Forget dinner.
mobile1534	This is all so unreal.
mobile1535	Will give you more shortly.
mobile1536	If it has to be pushed to next year, that works, but if it can be done it needs to be.
mobile1537	Sorry for the delay.
mobile1538	Let me know if there is any kind of problem in responding to Rod.
mobile1539	Had a great meeting.
mobile1540	I knew things were bad based on what you said.
mobile1541	At that time I sidelined the issue as it was complex, bearing in mind everything else that was going on.
mobile1542	Please coordinate with him.
mobile1543	In Kansas City today closing a deal with Missouri Gas.
mobile1544	What level of detail do you need?
mobile1545	Speak soon and take care - if I hear anything (other than what is on CNBC!) I will let you know.
mobile1546	Send to me.
mobile1547	Let's stay downtown then.
mobile1548	Kim has to travel to Indonesia on business February 8 to February 19.
mobile1549	You have approval to submit a request to the cash committee via Doug Sewell.
mobile1550	How did you make sure it was the right set?
mobile1551	7138536178
mobile1552	Best,
mobile1553	It has made a big difference.
mobile1554	Hope everything is going OK at home.
mobile1555	I know Trey and Cam will be there.
mobile1556	In Chicago.
mobile1557	Please stay on top of the security issue.
mobile1558	If possible, I'd like to get Amy's opinion.
mobile1559	We are currently working on options to have the roles each of the resources you have identified performed by the resources in the Estate.
mobile1560	As you know, this stinks.
mobile1561	I'll get with him by phone to confirm.
mobile1562	The view now is to minimize costs and move toward a sale of our A to B rights as a withdrawn partner to WMB or TCPL, or we may negotiate a deal that would allow us a back in interest if we pay a promote at a given point in the future.
mobile1563	AIG has agreed capital call not due until Monday.
mobile1564	AA has asked if we can repay the notes to the pipes.
mobile1565	The meeting is to try and get Portland back in line on timings - we clearly should not be in a position to trade physically immediately but within a month.
mobile1566	Dan.
mobile1567	Stay tuned for "restructuring plan" (aka layoffs) next week.
mobile1568	Have we assigned employees to NetCo?
mobile1569	Jeff worked for EES before and came to us highly recommended.
mobile1570	Jeff.
mobile1571	It is true I have other offers, but none are new.
mobile1572	Could you email me the new sentence on page 2?
mobile1573	Am I getting a good package?
mobile1574	Capital for Red Rock between 2001 and 2002.
mobile1575	We went to Palacios to fish.
mobile1576	Now, the rumor in Houston is that we are filing Chapter 11 on Monday.
mobile1577	GP is general partner in NB.
mobile1578	I have never seen such courage and strength in an uncertain environment.
mobile1579	Let me know if I can be of help.
mobile1580	Hope all is well.
mobile1581	I worked on the grade level promotion.
mobile1582	I understand Houston is to get some very cold weather in the next couple days!
mobile1583	Thanks
mobile1584	The party at AA is Roger Willard.
mobile1585	I have a request.
mobile1586	Message received.
mobile1587	Better than most recently.
mobile1588	Tells me he went through all collateral issues on these deals with Wendi Lebrocq in credit last week and everything tied exactly.
mobile1589	I scratched my cornea playing basketball or have a conjunctivitis infection in my eye.
mobile1590	I will not be available.
mobile1591	Are you interested in dinner tomorrow night at cafe express?
mobile1592	I'm still running point until I find Ward.
mobile1593	I am working with Mary Joyce on that right now.
mobile1594	That's all the email addresses I can think of now.
mobile1595	I'll send you minutes.
mobile1596	You're the greatest.
mobile1597	Thanks, Lynn
mobile1598	What is this?
mobile1599	Could you find Peter Mims number at VE?
mobile1600	Due to the limited amount of vacation time I am allotted from my employer, I am going to find it necessary to forego all vacation opportunities for the next 10 months (other than this week between Christmas and New Years) and hence find it necessary to use the specified time to obtain the coveted certification.
mobile1601	Don't know
mobile1602	I also wanted to thank you for your flexibility in covering both the gas control desks and the measurement desk.
mobile1603	Travis is in charge.
mobile1604	Presto, Belden, Sager, Nicholai and I are meeting 9:30 Wednesday to discuss.
mobile1605	Can you handle?
mobile1606	Will call when I leave.
mobile1607	Through this account cash flows to corporate.
mobile1608	Thanks again for all of your help in this effort.
mobile1609	Let's make sure we are ready!
mobile1610	Are you listening or video conferencing into this meeting?
mobile1611	I am not expecting any of this today, but it's nice to have things to look forward to.
mobile1612	Also, I'm sure that you have heard the perils of Enron.
mobile1613	There are files that back up the revenue projections that Steve Kleb gave me hard copies of for 2001 and 2002.
mobile1614	We lost some of our better marketers due to this issue - I don't want to lose more in 6 or 12 months.
mobile1615	Zero to five percent.
mobile1616	I am in the Pittsburg airport trying to forget about work.
mobile1617	FYI I saw Ken Caminiti at Animal Kingdom yesterday!
mobile1618	Test
mobile1619	I don't know that I will be back Monday.
mobile1620	Chip Schneider
mobile1621	That is so sad.
mobile1622	The power is executed, I just need to get the cert signed.
mobile1623	Just kidding!
mobile1624	I would suggest you and Mark address this together.
mobile1625	Poor Jack.
mobile1626	Their key decision maker did not show which is not a good sign.
mobile1627	I am in a due diligence meeting until 6:00.
mobile1628	We are in a loop.
mobile1629	If hair doesn't work then how about coffee?
mobile1630	Love,
mobile1631	Deb,
mobile1632	Just make sure you work with Kevin he may need assistance.
mobile1633	Um, no sir.
mobile1634	I appreciate you moving so quickly on this.
mobile1635	If you need me I'm in the cafeteria for five minutes.
mobile1636	I told him he's reporting to you and Milly and he was pleased.
mobile1637	What do you think about Tracy and Jim?
mobile1638	Are you in a good mood?
mobile1639	Thank you, Ricki.
mobile1640	Can you help get this cleared up?
mobile1641	Next week sounds fine for vacation.
mobile1642	Thanks Lynn.
mobile1643	I have a high level in my office.
mobile1644	These logins are to allow the UBS schedulers to continue to perform for us after their login is converted to the UBS system.
mobile1645	I think we should try to sell some of our in the money positions.
mobile1646	Approximately half is due to organic cash flow.
mobile1647	I haven't had a conversation on this since 1999.
mobile1648	36178
mobile1649	Thanks I will.
mobile1650	I'm working on a liquidity forecast.
mobile1651	If we don't get it, could be trouble.
mobile1652	Plan to schedule Meetings with DUK, SEM, PGE during first week of December.
mobile1653	Otherwise, it would need to be early or after 10.
mobile1654	Did you set up my corporate account for me?
mobile1655	Is there any way to just reduce the expenses for now?
mobile1656	Are you being a baby?
mobile1657	So if we are going on a weekend, why are you telling Robyn?
mobile1658	Rick
mobile1659	Did you get this?
mobile1660	Maybe traffic will be light on Thursday.
mobile1661	Mike is putting pressure on me.
mobile1662	I thought we already reached an agreement to buy them.
mobile1663	He also will have to honor noncompete.
mobile1664	Bill and Maria, please plan on calling in if at all possible.
mobile1665	Regards
mobile1666	Steve and I have been asked to work with McGown and Steve Kirk on the SLA settlement.
mobile1667	As to solicitation of employees back and forth, it will be a negotiated deal term.
mobile1668	I believe that now that we have signed, there is no condition precedent that will allow for the board to say no to the deal.
mobile1669	Kind of like silent fireworks.
mobile1670	Would you please give me a call at your earliest convenience.
mobile1671	Can you get with Mary and make sure?
mobile1672	Where are you DSM boy?
mobile1673	We want the terms to be firm and as specific as the version we had on Friday (although I take point about arbitration and vesting of rest stock - although we have to insert something in here).
mobile1674	I hope never to have to go through that type of experience again.
mobile1675	Barclays returned our calls suggesting they would think about alternatives including rolling deal as is and be back to us by 6 AM.
mobile1676	She has the game tomorrow.
mobile1677	I'm on a plane.
mobile1678	Florida is great.
mobile1679	I sent it to her.
mobile1680	What is the status of the Pemex discussions?
mobile1681	Crystal
mobile1682	Can you supplement the answer to the visa question?
mobile1683	I am meeting with my direct reports at 1 to work on recommendations.
mobile1684	I will call.
mobile1685	Please let me know if you learn anything at the floor meeting.
mobile1686	No other major projects underway that are impacted by Enron's situation.
mobile1687	I may try to call you a bit later on storage but we did not see that deal.
mobile1688	Has there been any announcements on the Dynegy deal?
mobile1689	I was going to call you but I hate to bother your holiday.
mobile1690	Remember blackberry doesn't work so well at home.
mobile1691	What's wrong?
mobile1692	He will walk Tanya Rohauer through the exact same steps tomorrow.
mobile1693	Please revise accordingly.
mobile1694	At this point in time Dynegy will be responsible for this debt, if they exercise their rights under the preferred stock agreements, which would leave them with common pledged to the lenders.
mobile1695	I don't have the distraction of taking care of Mimi.
mobile1696	I think afraid of mass exodus.
mobile1697	Please confirm.
mobile1698	We are off to the UK in a couple of days so we'll come and see you when you get back.
mobile1699	On call with S&P now.
mobile1700	Could you see where this stands?
mobile1701	Unless you really believe that you can pull off Richard's project which sounds huge.
mobile1702	We will need to get your signature on a few docs.
mobile1703	Did we get from Lisa the appropriate internal account opening form from Lisa yet?
mobile1704	Meet at arriving passenger area at lower level.
mobile1705	Danny,
mobile1706	Sorry for the unfriendly greeting in the lobby.
mobile1707	I need to talk to Tom Carlton, their decision-maker.
mobile1708	Apparently, John was told that I had a problem with this.
mobile1709	I will submit that that may be the case today.
mobile1710	Yes I like perfume.
mobile1711	I'm going to class.
mobile1712	I have got to get out there, as you can appreciate!
mobile1713	I was wondering if I could use some of the frozen veggies to make a casserole?
mobile1714	Did you have any questions regarding the GMS cost numbers I gave you yesterday?
mobile1715	Nightmare.
mobile1716	See you on the third.
mobile1717	I heard.
mobile1718	Smaller, ad hoc meetings are more appropriate until the marketing agreements are finalized.
mobile1719	Hey, so should we be nervous about Kori coming back on Monday?
mobile1720	Did we get ours back?
mobile1721	She indicated that the indemnities in the contribution agreement covered the matters addressed in this draft and that she was told no more indemnities were to be made.
mobile1722	I will be traveling out of the country next week.
mobile1723	Hugh
mobile1724	The rate case settlement represented a compromise approach to shifting more responsibility to the peak.
mobile1725	Diane has info from Littler on its proposed training.
mobile1726	Let's leave it until we get going.
mobile1727	Question 1: my "need" would more appropriately be characterized as a "desire" (something that, according to my Buddhism class yesterday, would be beneficial to give up if I want to achieve true happiness).
mobile1728	They both have the sniffles and I have a sore throat.
mobile1729	Per Stan this AM.
mobile1730	I think we have credit working on 77 and we should start compiling the next list.
mobile1731	I realize this is short notice, but if you don't have lunch plans for Tuesday, I'd love it if you could join Kay Mann and me for lunch at Damians.
mobile1732	Do you have a number for him?
mobile1733	We're using Weil.
mobile1734	PS: your gift made my day.
mobile1735	It's an entity set up to handle NNG's and TW's cash.
mobile1736	Did you get OK from your partners to publish 401K info to public and employees?
mobile1737	You're right - typo
mobile1738	I wasn't able to use the global phone in Kazakhstan.
mobile1739	What is up with ENE?
mobile1740	I'll call you in the morning.
mobile1741	I am afraid Dan would worry if he knew about Julia unless she has left him a message.
mobile1742	Can talk about 1 more if needed.
mobile1743	We are all doing reasonably well, I think.
mobile1744	I may be in tomorrow too after I make sure Alina won't freak out with the babysitter.
mobile1745	If so we can meet at Highland Village - Grotto is it?
mobile1746	The other figure is the top 15 contracts.
mobile1747	Yes please explain that 8 need doctor's signature so she can start preschool Tuesday.
mobile1748	Please handle.
mobile1749	I'd tell her that we have actual tickets for games on March 9 (Astros) and March 13 (Indians), but otherwise just plan to buy the day of the game.
mobile1750	Are you sure?
mobile1751	Go for the dollars.
mobile1752	I do wish I knew.
mobile1753	3 - true.
mobile1754	She was leaving Omaha for Houston at 4:00.
mobile1755	I'll need to come back soon, but I think it is time for me to go.
mobile1756	FYI.
mobile1757	Should I go ahead and make hotel and car reservations for California?
mobile1758	I didn't think we had.
mobile1759	Sorry about that!
mobile1760	I called Tom at 8:30 this morning.
mobile1761	We think it may be payable as a past expense.
mobile1762	Met with APS: undecided, need to meet with key decision-maker.
mobile1763	Louise
mobile1764	So I need your spreadsheets ASAP.
mobile1765	I know the place we intend to go is on an island off the eastern coast of
mobile1766	I have a doctor's appointment for 11:00 on Tuesday.
mobile1767	Do you need to be there?
mobile1768	Let me know if I need to make adjustments.
mobile1769	Hope you had a good weekend.
mobile1770	Had we not run into the El Paso issues the number would have held.
mobile1771	All OK
mobile1772	Went well.
mobile1773	That would be a good idea.
mobile1774	I hate not being there but I think these other meetings are big enough to have presence in Omaha.
mobile1775	Is that OK?
mobile1776	Eugene Lee
mobile1777	I am on your calendar tomorrow afternoon and can explain further.
mobile1778	East Coast should be essentially flat.
mobile1779	How's the share price?
mobile1780	Shelly, there will be no one from my group unless I go up to meet with Minnegasco.
mobile1781	Are you sure - David and Ellie's outbound flight is 17:31.
mobile1782	I guess we are almost there right?
mobile1783	Should we email this to you or fax to your house?
mobile1784	I'm discouraged to still be sick (asthma or bronchitis or the like).
mobile1785	I would say that we should honor the terms of any sale or acquisition agreement with regards to service bridging.
mobile1786	Do you have any handouts on TW's 2002 business plan?
mobile1787	Jan has a lot of detail.
mobile1788	Need to watch closely.
mobile1789	Do we know what we need?
mobile1790	What do you think?
mobile1791	Good luck.
mobile1792	Please send me a copy of the proposal and cover letter.
mobile1793	I should have more info by our meeting this afternoon.
mobile1794	Does Dan know about Julia changing groups?
mobile1795	Can you bring these to 49C1?
mobile1796	I have no personal transactions with any Enron entity.
mobile1797	My number is 713-218-7155.
mobile1798	Bring whole thing if this is the note agreement with ENE.
mobile1799	I need to help my Mom get organized on some things.
mobile1800	I can fill you in on more details later.
mobile1801	OK I'm thru with appointment and am on my way in.
mobile1802	She is taking over Global Finance Legal.
mobile1803	Nothing from Mom.
mobile1804	713 646 6360 if you feel up to trying to convince him.
mobile1805	Red Rock capacity is 107,000.
mobile1806	Is everything out, or is there more to come (Kilmer is about ready to blow an artery)?
mobile1807	She was going to leave at 8 or 9.
mobile1808	Just sitting around.
mobile1809	November 14 works for me.
mobile1810	I can't open attachments - can you cut and paste?
mobile1811	Their lead won't tell me over the phone but we are schedule to get together at lunch to discuss.
mobile1812	Thanks for asking.
mobile1813	Nepotism Policy - UBS have one and I'm worried about Marcus.
mobile1814	I mean make the move to the US.
mobile1815	I think as long as Enron is performing, I'm not sure why there is all of this noise.
mobile1816	Also it appears no payment is required tomorrow.
mobile1817	Sure, why don't you send them over to me (snail mail is fine)?
mobile1818	It will be very quiet all week.
mobile1819	He'll live.
mobile1820	I forgot one person when we spoke on Friday.
mobile1821	I agree.
mobile1822	I didn't know what her new title was supposed to be.
mobile1823	Could you mark up the LLC opinion and fax it to Suzanne Adams at 7136463491?
mobile1824	I'm in 49C1.
mobile1825	Currently at the drug test place there are lots of ENE people on the list.
mobile1826	I will need to have my memory refreshed.
mobile1827	Are you there?
mobile1828	I can review afterwards and get back to you tonight.
mobile1829	I don't plan for us to sign on, we'll just wait for it to hit the board for vote.
mobile1830	I hope he is having a fantastic time.
mobile1831	Cameron
mobile1832	Please send me an email to let me know.
mobile1833	If I leave here I will call your cell so you know how to reach me.
mobile1834	How much?
mobile1835	But a friend recently rented one and used in Europe.
mobile1836	Can Mark Ellenberg participate?
mobile1837	Jeff,
mobile1838	I am available tomorrow afternoon.
mobile1839	Regards.
mobile1840	I can't wait to get my half of our prize!
mobile1841	I'm out of office till Wednesday.
mobile1842	Please send Tomy direct reports.
mobile1843	I assume the severance question is only going to former employees, but the doctor question goes to both current and former employees.
mobile1844	Working on it
mobile1845	NERCO is waiting.
mobile1846	Danny I recommended on Monday we cancel it.
mobile1847	If so Whitt is done?
mobile1848	If he wants it.
mobile1849	This is the second year in a row Kevin has backed out on interviewing at the last minute.
mobile1850	I appreciate your questions and comments and await your reply.
mobile1851	Wishing you both a very nice Christmas!
mobile1852	Not very good.
mobile1853	It was very nice.
mobile1854	It appears that EESI and EPMI were mixed up.
mobile1855	I do not want to have to go to the cash committee every day.
mobile1856	We will also need his fax number.
mobile1857	Happy Holidays
mobile1858	It's raining here.
mobile1859	I can't get online, only blackberry, but got gist of message.
mobile1860	Hey!
mobile1861	Can you resend me the Doyle email from last week?
mobile1862	If so what was it?
mobile1863	I'm in Stan's office.
mobile1864	I have some gift certificates for Ann T, Gap and Gymboree.
mobile1865	However you would have to agree that we have some level of control over the GP.
mobile1866	It's death or Dynegy, with no clear leader.
mobile1867	I don't think they formally backed out, but effectively that is what has happened.
mobile1868	$40M in by Tuesday.
mobile1869	Dave - please call Larry and find out what is up before I speak with David Field.
mobile1870	Tim's assistant tried to pull rank on my assistant because "we are a trading company now"!
mobile1871	I think he is utility player that can fill several roles, but if your team won't need help, I'm not sure if I need him.
mobile1872	If you already have forwarded the memo please pass along the warning and ask them not to forward again.
mobile1873	Unbelievable.
mobile1874	I talked to Hayslette on my way out Thursday night about this so he is anticipating it today and he'll forward it on to Karon to get a PO cut.
mobile1875	We will be managing our rates and we need to plan on software.
mobile1876	Invite Frank, Laura, Tycholiz, Lagrasta, Breslau, Duran, Forster, Calger, and Foster.
mobile1877	Maybe she will be too preoccupied about whether she has a job or not!
mobile1878	Buy and Pug said that non-core assets less than $500 million did not need board approval.
mobile1879	Hey TK, how are you doing?
mobile1880	We in the process of making a change.
mobile1881	If you need John speak up now.
mobile1882	Can you ask Wes to bring the proforma too (15 copies)?
mobile1883	We will not decide till next week as you know.
mobile1884	John, it may be best we can achieve here is an indicative draft which we talk with top 20 about and tee them up for real thing circa January 10.
mobile1885	In isolation, all of these things are trivial.
mobile1886	Is there anything major going on?
mobile1887	The troops just walked in.
mobile1888	Don't forget the wood.
mobile1889	It is no problem.
mobile1890	We need to give them a defined group for day one.
mobile1891	Hi Suz,
mobile1892	Good plan.
mobile1893	I'm available by cell when you get data points.
mobile1894	We are somewhat emasculated bystanders.
mobile1895	But we should pay them the 4500.
mobile1896	Did you budget to use the company plane in 2002?
mobile1897	Both
mobile1898	Thanks, Lynn.
mobile1899	This seems fine to me.
mobile1900	I need a chauffeur when we arrive to take us either to King's Cross to get a train or go all the way home.
mobile1901	I will tell them.
mobile1902	Skyline refers to added seasonality that NNG proposed to add to its rates.
mobile1903	Man I don't want to get sick again.
mobile1904	JWB
mobile1905	Greg
mobile1906	Unless the BOD is planning on a new CEO, this is unlikely to happen.
mobile1907	We were just downgraded to B- by S and P.
mobile1908	Seemed fine when I picked him up.
mobile1909	We can work with it either way.
mobile1910	About time
mobile1911	I enjoyed our discussion very much.
mobile1912	There is some type of retrade underway from the Bill Wise level.
mobile1913	I would think that if they pay in advance it should not be a problem,
mobile1914	Hi
mobile1915	Are you back in town?
mobile1916	Answer is you would get severance and their plan is quite generous (presuming RIF rather than performance reason for separation).
mobile1917	I am forwarding all the emails to her attention.
mobile1918	Hanover deal done.
mobile1919	Let's make sure we have all bases covered and telephone tree in place.
mobile1920	I think FMV is probably less than fifty.
mobile1921	Check and find out form?
mobile1922	I still believe a September 30 closing is unrealistic.
mobile1923	This is the crew.
mobile1924	Rick, I have a number of contracts that the bankers want early tomorrow.
mobile1925	Can you pick me up at 11:09AM Continental flight 659?
mobile1926	We are supposed to land at 3PM.
mobile1927	I'm about to return to the office to see it.
mobile1928	They played dirty, Michael hung tough.
mobile1929	What a pain.
mobile1930	I thought you needed him to carry two people.
mobile1931	I think in this case specific is better.
mobile1932	Pressure to finish my review!
mobile1933	I like it.
mobile1934	San Francisco was Interconnect meeting.
mobile1935	About 15 minutes.
mobile1936	The commercial staff has been very concerned about the lack of daily data and I haven't made much headway with the GMS folks.
mobile1937	So it is all in Ginger's hands now.
mobile1938	I approve.
mobile1939	I have 30 minutes then.
mobile1940	Mikey is invited also.
mobile1941	Jim.
mobile1942	Why don't you ask Shanna Funkhouser for the details?
mobile1943	Yes
mobile1944	What are the units?
mobile1945	I'll ask, he just came by.
mobile1946	And be patient as there is no timeline.
mobile1947	See you tomorrow.
mobile1948	Do I want to be represented by someone named Lawless?
mobile1949	I am leaving the lake.
mobile1950	We can discuss in much more detail at our 9 AM meeting tomorrow.
mobile1951	Make sure you keep Dot and Drew in the loop on this stuff.
mobile1952	I'm very sad, a bit angry with the doctors, and tired.
mobile1953	I have master counterparty lists from credit, legal and EOL.
mobile1954	I don't know how to get in touch with Mike outside of the office.
mobile1955	You might say that we are lending the money to Enron and therefore are now looking further than NNG and NW.
mobile1956	Could I ask the two of you to please insure that there is a refreshed view on the legal risks relative to both our and El Paso's litigation on East Coast Power.
mobile1957	Did you mean Oxley?
mobile1958	Who should I contact regarding severance?
mobile1959	We are going to hedge / manage our own interest rate risk so we will need infinity so can you please make sure it's (infinity add-ons) is in the document.
mobile1960	Sounds right.
mobile1961	Check with Vince Strohmeyer.
mobile1962	I heard Peter and Travis will be working with her.
mobile1963	Jared,
mobile1964	I would agree.
mobile1965	Yummy!
mobile1966	I will let you know the outcome when it's resolved.
mobile1967	Mom's email is rmccall@airmail.net.
mobile1968	I'm taking Wednesday off.
mobile1969	I can get them.
mobile1970	Just a thought - I think our PR people and outside law firm should stop referring to NetCo as a joint venture - it hurts our ability to get commercial and regulatory agreements in place.
mobile1971	JA always understands.
mobile1972	I don't know who/what got everything stirred up today.
mobile1973	Where do you want to meet to go over there?
mobile1974	Dallas.
mobile1975	I am monitoring email.
mobile1976	The objective seems to have gotten a little lost here.
mobile1977	Ring Teresa at Jaegar and ask if she can get me another plum top (sleeveless).
mobile1978	Call me anytime for information.
mobile1979	I will need you to resurrect your language on the gas for Mitch tomorrow.
mobile1980	I am staying at the W Hotel.
mobile1981	Will it be delivered?
mobile1982	I will try to get a copy of the waiver.
mobile1983	Yes I would like to attend the conference and would love to get together while you are in town.
mobile1984	DS
mobile1985	Please work with the folks to make sure this happens ASAP as they need to have access before Monday due to the UBS cutover.
mobile1986	After that meeting Dari, Mary and I are going to review procedures for any changes.
mobile1987	Ava, please get with TK and let her know if we have some pens she can have.
mobile1988	If Jeff says it is okay, then I take comfort in that given my relationship with Jeff.
mobile1989	Incredible.
mobile1990	I have received your messages and will respond accordingly.
mobile1991	I make this about 15 full time people and probably the equivalent of another 7-10 for these other functions, plus their expenses.
mobile1992	So it reads UBS Warburg Energy.
mobile1993	Eric
mobile1994	Still tied up.
mobile1995	I likely will be arriving late, so probably should pass.
mobile1996	I'm not close enough right now to the discussion.
mobile1997	Just my thoughts.
mobile1998	Bill is doing a great job on this.
mobile1999	We may need more logins if there are multiple people required to schedule.
mobile2000	Then they should go home.
mobile2001	Robyn
mobile2002	Brian is working this.
mobile2003	On a comparative basis I can't justify more.
mobile2004	If not, I could use help with mulching the beds before I plant.
mobile2005	What information, if any, do we owe him?
mobile2006	I think you need to push Wasaff.
mobile2007	Make sure they are current.
mobile2008	Was wondering if you and Natalie connected?
mobile2009	These assets are still owned, controlled and consolidated on ENE's balance sheet.
mobile2010	Not at this time.
mobile2011	Do we have New York sorted out?
mobile2012	Can you try to get Lavo and preview with him how these meetings go?
mobile2013	I've talked with Stephen Douglas about getting the cash back early through a repurchase of the preferred shares ECC issued to Corp earlier this year.
mobile2014	There is a meeting Thursday morning with Dave and Mary Kay.
mobile2015	We did 4 meetings yesterday and have 4 more today and one more by phone tomorrow.
mobile2016	Where?
mobile2017	Sheila please talk to Avashe.
mobile2018	Sorry I missed choir last night.
mobile2019	I hope so.
mobile2020	Shelley
mobile2021	John
mobile2022	I'm on the 6th floor of the new building.
mobile2023	See also if we can get something from Lorna Brennan.
mobile2024	Hard times.
mobile2025	Okay I'll go for a ticket.
mobile2026	I'll give you my handwritten notes.
mobile2027	There are still some remaining issues to be sorted out.
mobile2028	John, please send this to Shelly.
mobile2029	Thanks, Kevin.
mobile2030	Thanks anyway.
mobile2031	I need to get a PO cut on Friday.
mobile2032	I don't know what I will be doing.
mobile2033	Plus me, Julie Clyatt and a share of corporate charges for payroll, benefits, EEOC (compliance), HRIS, other AA stuff and Corp reporting.
mobile2034	Great!
mobile2035	Not actually, but realistically from business unrelated to the pipes.
mobile2036	I am starting to get nervous about seeing Kori tomorrow!
mobile2037	There are possible situations where we will need to call on them for coverage and assistance in this transition.
mobile2038	How so?
mobile2039	I guess that's it for now.
mobile2040	Lisa now has everything.
mobile2041	I will get Georgie to call you.
mobile2042	I'll give it to you tomorrow.
mobile2043	I hate doing this, but I owe it to Michael, since I really want to keep him in private school.
mobile2044	If you have any follow up comments don't hesitate to call.
mobile2045	I'm still here.
mobile2046	I received the message from Rod on California demand.
mobile2047	I'm lost!
mobile2048	DWD
mobile2049	I'll be in this afternoon and will give you a call
mobile2050	What's up?
mobile2051	I'm glad you are involved!
mobile2052	He doesn't want to give the trading positions.
mobile2053	Any news?
mobile2054	PR seems to think that Glen signed off on doing it.
mobile2055	He is at EB where she is doing a Super Saturday.
mobile2056	I'll call you when I get to the office.
mobile2057	I would like an updated copy of the schedule you brought me with a description from the representatives about why the customer is saying that they haven't paid.
mobile2058	It will all be public someday.
mobile2059	One final New Year's email: the Netco startup plan for power is assuming 45-60 days to get a FERC license, 60-120 days to get transmission and pool agreements, etc. so transaction volumes will be trivial for the first few months unless we look at some new approaches such as buying a small marketer.
mobile2060	We will get you a copy.
mobile2061	You are welcome in Palacios this weekend, of course.
mobile2062	Thanks, having a good time.
mobile2063	Are you two available Thursday AM to review the IT capital for NNG with Dynegy?
mobile2064	If we have already signed up and can't get the money back then spread the word that is OK.
mobile2065	Please set something up.
mobile2066	FAX 212 253 9229
mobile2067	John, if the meeting is Monday I have jury duty.
mobile2068	What interview?
mobile2069	You of all people know how hard yesterday was for me.
mobile2070	Any time Thursday.
mobile2071	What is the shower at Patsy's for?
mobile2072	The wording needs to be tight and regardless of its enforceability make above clear.
mobile2073	Met with Senators in DC.
mobile2074	Gary, I would be glad to do a presentation for your group.
mobile2075	You should be getting a fax from Maurice regarding EES LLC opinion.
mobile2076	I will give you a call tomorrow night when I get back to town.
mobile2077	No, at least not to my knowledge.
mobile2078	I will follow up with him as soon as the dust settles.
mobile2079	Michelle Lokey has 269,000 coming in from WMB as an OBA settlement today or tomorrow into the new account.
mobile2080	Stop working weekends again.
mobile2081	Regarding Canada: Rob is predicting $462M Canadian cash balance for year end.
mobile2082	These are big storms and traffic isn't moving.
mobile2083	We had a VP PRC meeting Thursday.
mobile2084	Thanks for checking,
mobile2085	Do you have a number for Steve?
mobile2086	I vote for the latter.
mobile2087	Telephone 212 253 9119
mobile2088	Here is the message.
mobile2089	We don't want to look bad to Dyn.
mobile2090	Yes, I will do so.
mobile2091	For my money, I think if we kept Michael, we could get rid of all of our analysts and associates, and still handle our development deals and sales.
mobile2092	Call me at 832.865.2445.
mobile2093	Talk to you soon.
mobile2094	Either way we will limit further funds from going out the door.
mobile2095	Lynn, got to the office OK.
mobile2096	Some of it is ridiculous but some of it could go away if we changed a few things.
mobile2097	I think he'll be done at his current offer, do you want to give him more?
mobile2098	It may be an hour.
mobile2099	Hi Sue.
mobile2100	Heather Dunton
mobile2101	No, I am not interested in getting certified in Monterey Bay.
mobile2102	I think it is best for her not to work here, as she obviously wasn't happy.
mobile2103	Jim please confirm to Vince you are happy.
mobile2104	We are also doing a due diligence all day Thursday with Dynegy on NNG.
mobile2105	If he'll sign no issues with Barclays.
mobile2106	Presuming they did, seems to me it is reasonable to assume this is what the deal will actually be (Lance also mentioned creditor committee had seen Umbrella's term sheet last week).
mobile2107	Please transfer the balance from my personal to my corporate.
mobile2108	The assets are still warehoused off balance sheet and fortunately El Paso's credit spreads have been trading in to our benefit.
mobile2109	We're on the way.
mobile2110	Or are you going to be tied up with dinner?
mobile2111	Where's Jeanie?
mobile2112	Hope your week is going well.
mobile2113	No
mobile2114	I don't think the stock price is the key piece of the puzzle, as it doesn't impact value of the biz.
mobile2115	Please do.
mobile2116	I'm trying.
mobile2117	Is this the only time available?
mobile2118	We just pulled schedules from the web.
mobile2119	I can call Jan at home so I can get access.
mobile2120	Not currently under consideration, in fact would be a problem
mobile2121	Groovy
mobile2122	Good luck!
mobile2123	OK I'm fine.
mobile2124	Love me.
mobile2125	I am going to be available in a few minutes.
mobile2126	Let me know if you want me to check the latest version.
mobile2127	Did you get the message to call Mary Kay?
mobile2128	Did not take the chance to tell about the outage.
mobile2129	Even Michael was impressed.
mobile2130	No there will be plenty of others.
mobile2131	I woke up and couldn't get back to sleep.
mobile2132	However let's wait and see if we can get one more draft done for Wednesday.
mobile2133	What is the purpose of this?
mobile2134	To the degree the underlying asset would support less than book value upon a quick liquidation, the put/call price protection embeds more Enron risk in the financing.
mobile2135	I have not seen any numbers nor have I heard from Faith.
mobile2136	First objective is to keep electricity flowing.
mobile2137	There is a possibility SoCal could reduce capacity at ID2.
mobile2138	Heard your name on TV last night.
mobile2139	I will try to reach you on Wednesday.
mobile2140	What do you think about that sir?
mobile2141	Looks good.
mobile2142	11:45
mobile2143	Please ask Wes to come over for 9:30 or earlier.
mobile2144	We need to send read only IDs to all our customers.
mobile2145	I plan to work tomorrow some on the data and can hopefully get you something for Friday.
mobile2146	No can do.
mobile2147	If you guys already mulched last week, then I can manage the planting on my own.
mobile2148	They are specifically concerned about the current intercompany notes.
mobile2149	Nice weather for it.
mobile2150	I think those are the right dates.
mobile2151	Love, me.
mobile2152	Accounting has been able to look in and find that they actually did have a third party.
mobile2153	But I hope to see you at Kari's house.
mobile2154	Please send me an email describing the changes he is requesting.
mobile2155	Do you want to go to the cafeteria for lunch?
mobile2156	Is there a meeting with Kevin Howard today on this?
mobile2157	See you soon
mobile2158	Does Friday at 10 work for you?
mobile2159	Thai sounds good.
mobile2160	I would suggest adding an acknowledgement at the bottom, where the person accepts the terms and conditions of the assignment letter and also authorizes the company to deduct the amounts described in the letter from final paycheck, vacation pay or other amounts to be paid to employee.
mobile2161	This message is about new building tour.
mobile2162	I enjoyed our discussion very much and was very impressed with your accomplishments and experience.
mobile2163	Starting when?
mobile2164	I can be there within the hour.
mobile2165	Fingers crossed?
mobile2166	You too!
mobile2167	Do you want to fax it to my hotel?
mobile2168	Would you like to take Cam?
mobile2169	He walked me through outstanding issues on Alamac that he is working with Duran and Heather to resolve.
mobile2170	I do not need the bill to go to my home address.
mobile2171	I'm sitting in the airport waiting on the plane.
mobile2172	I meant to try and explain, not to redo.
mobile2173	Cool is it not.
mobile2174	See you later.
mobile2175	I just told Kathy to send an email to my direct reports.
mobile2176	Also, please check with K Young to see what is in place.
mobile2177	Frankly I would rather have AK across from us than other counsel because I think that they will be cognizant of future potential and probably won't be too obnoxious.
mobile2178	Can I get electronic copies of these, they have volumes and margins and appear to back up the revenue projections.
mobile2179	We cannot say the interstate pipelines are agreeing - as this would take agreement of our partners.
mobile2180	The covering memo should be explicit in asking the EE to confirm that if a deal was presented in substantially these terms, they would sign them.
mobile2181	Is Derrick OK with it?
mobile2182	So I'll see you at the airport?
mobile2183	Did you differ from me?
mobile2184	If anyone asks just say I'm in Dallas and you don't know why.
mobile2185	Right?
mobile2186	My husband is in Indonesia on business, so don't be surprised if I reply in the middle of the night when kids are asleep and I can concentrate.
mobile2187	No.
mobile2188	Thanks for your help in quickly setting this up.
mobile2189	Hang in there guys.
mobile2190	Works for me.
mobile2191	Thanks - that's what I was hoping it was.
mobile2192	It will interfere with every dinner, theatre, social event you plan.
mobile2193	Cool
mobile2194	Just in case we haven't invited any of them.
mobile2195	Didn't get a commitment.
mobile2196	713 622 6405
mobile2197	Please email me Randy Pais and David Marshall's phone numbers.
mobile2198	Are you sure I don't need to be there?
mobile2199	Go ahead and notify.
mobile2200	I wasn't going to mention it, but I was wondering if he had heard about it yet.
mobile2201	I want the payment from the final bill to go to the corporate account as well.
mobile2202	It should be Cynthia Barow instead.
mobile2203	It worked.
mobile2204	I doubt that it is forecasted.
mobile2205	Will get with you Wednesday but feel free to schedule anything after 12:00.
mobile2206	If I hear anything I will let you know.
mobile2207	Can you meet at T and C on Sunday afternoon.
mobile2208	See, it's cold enough for hot chocolate!
mobile2209	I am getting lots of questions.
mobile2210	So the language does have value.
mobile2211	I'll email later tonight.
mobile2212	How did they get onto our floor?
mobile2213	All the kids were cute.
mobile2214	If you want I can try to nail down some names for these people but I'm not sure that makes a whole lot of sense.
mobile2215	Will that work?
mobile2216	Reclass both please.
mobile2217	I agree with Morris.
mobile2218	Do you know how much capacity is available to sell in the plan for 2002 and is not sold, i.e. how much capacity is not being utilized?
