This will be hard.

Have a good evening.

Sounds good to me.

Yes I am here actually.

Tonight is my anniversary.

Will follow up today.

That's a lot of dollars.

Thanks for the surprise.

I hoped you did.

We'll let you know.

Yes I am coming twice.

Sorry I'm losing it.

Thank you, dear.

He can't help himself.

Thanks for your offer.

Was it a car wreck?

Is she done yet?

Thanks for the quick turnaround.

Have a good weekend.

See you on Friday.

More bad Enron news?

Michael has his holiday performance.

Thus have nothing to destroy.

Wish me luck with Linda.

Yes, I am playing.

Mostly a social call.

Please call tomorrow if possible.

We are all fragile.

It will probably be tomorrow.

I can return earlier.

I am trying again.

I will bring John Brindle.

What do you hear?

Thanks I needed that today!

Hi, how are things there?

What is your issue sir?

What a nice note.

John, thanks for the update.

I was answering Janet's comment.

So should I drive tomorrow?

I'm still in Dallas!

Is Cassandra there today?

I like Nick and Everett.

Shouldn't be too hard though.

In a couple of weeks.

I am walking in now.

They have capacity now.

Will he come down Wetheimer?

A gift isn't necessary.

See you next week.

Chris Foster is in!

No, but thanks.

They are more efficiently pooled.

Let's discuss in the morning.

Same camp as Davies, Lagrasta.

I'm open, though.

Producers reacting to price management.

Just wanted to touch base.

I am getting home early.

Thanks again for your help.

I'll be thinking of you.

Could you try ringing her?

What a crazy day.

Do you need it today?

Will call later to explain.

Joel will handle this.

What is going on?

Your kind thoughts are appreciated.

John this message concerns me.

Did we plan that?

This will make my week.

Need anything from Target?

I'll probably page you.

Couldn't risk the uncertainty.

And leave my school alone.

I will be there.

What is in the plan?

I have no idea.

I'll get you details.

Anything exciting going on today?

Because there is traffic.

I am fine with this.

Presumably so do you.

We have the data.

Let's discuss the charges.

Are you going to apply?

Any news from Redmond?

Fran, yes please update.

Presuming we can afford headcount?

Milly is a seller.

I am almost speechless.

Take what you can get.

Should systems manage the migration?

Need before board meeting.

I'm glad you liked it.

Thanks for all your support.

I've never worked with her.

Get with Mary for format.

Have a great trip.

Tried reaching you earlier.

Has anyone else heard anything?

Hope you don't freeze tonight.

Did you see Laura's message.?

I'll get you one.

Seems unusual to me.

I just tracked down Steve.

You can talk to Becky!

I talked to Duran.

I agreed terms with Greg.

I am at the lake.

I told you silly.

Thanks for your concern.

Thursday works better for me.

Will reveal as appropriate.

I am all over it.

Did you hear Alice quit?

Heading in to see Moody's.

Little value to the pipes.

Just looking to gossip.

What is the mood?

Tracey is coming next weekend.

John Millar to report.

I am on my way.

Please leave it to Brian.

Do we need to discuss?

Just playing with you!

Tammie please forward to Duran.

Have a good trip.

What's your phone number?

Have you talked to Somerholder?

Thanks for checking with me.

This is very sensitive.

Thank you for your call.

On the plane, doors closing.

What did Mark say?

Treasa knows the details.

Are you in today?

Talk to you tomorrow.

Not in the near future.

Good to know it exists.

Do you know anything?

Have a great evening!

We just need a sitter.

We must be consistent.

Did you tell Steve?

She has absolutely everything.

Is this the conference rate?

This is good I think.

It is not surprising.

Please send to Gary Smith.

On my way down.

Is this a standard language?

I'm on a conference call.

No obligation to pay.

What does Hunter think?

Money wise that is.

Trip was good I presume?

That was so sweet.

Marisa sent the invoices.

Get with David Lund.

Weather is bad here.

Thanks for your kind words.

Talk to you later.

On my way back.

I am freaking out!

Maybe you can leave early.

What happened with Brent Price?

Will be a while.

Why do you ask?

Don't forget to pray.

I love you too.

I'd be happy to.

This looks fine with me.

She has a web address.

I was planning to attend.

That would be great.

Can you wait until Monday?

Can you help me here?

Probably will be working.

What is the cost issue?

I will resend to you.

Please send me an email.

Banks want to exclude goodwill.

Don't know how that happened.

You snooze you lose!

There is a God.

Jan, sorry for the inconvenience.

I got it, pal.

I will be back Friday.

Love to all, Kay.

I think it's over now.

It's not working very well.

I agree with Jim.

Confirmed with Mark Taylor.

Still waiting on decision.

You hang in there too.

Not even in yet.

We will keep trying.

Email the consent to me.

How are things with you?

Nothing but good news everyday.

Message is getting through.

I left a message.

Perhaps there was a glitch.

You can reply via email.

Geez, I sound pathetic.

I would like to discuss.

What happened to Savita?

Are you feeling better?

How is it going?

Neil has been asking around.

We are having fun.

I'm big on the Blackberry.

We'll be back Sunday.

I have been working those.

That is not true.

I will handle this afternoon.

I already deleted it.

Please forward to Kevin Howard.

Thanks for the plant.

Are you two talking?

Let's wait until Monday.

I have forwarded to Kelly.

Board meeting running long.

Have a great day!

So you're ignoring me.

I think I'm OK.

Your voice cheered me up.

Have a Happy Thanksgiving.

We will keep you posted.

Chip Schneider makes that call.

Will get back to you.

Are you going to call?

I hope you went.

Has it been mentioned yet?

This is all so unreal.

Will give you more shortly.

Sorry for the delay.

Had a great meeting.

Please coordinate with him.

Let's stay downtown then.

As you know, this stinks.

Hope all is well.

I have a request.

Better than most recently.

I will not be available.

I'll send you minutes.

Travis is in charge.

Will call when I leave.

Zero to five percent.

That is so sad.

We are in a loop.

Um, no sir.

Thank you, Ricki.

Are you being a baby?

Did you get this?

Kind of like silent fireworks.

She has the game tomorrow.

I'm on a plane.

I sent it to her.

Yes I like perfume.

I'm going to class.

See you on the third.

Did we get ours back?

Go for the dollars.

I do wish I knew.

I didn't think we had.

How's the share price?

Need to watch closely.

What do you think?

Can Mark Ellenberg participate?

I am available tomorrow afternoon.

Please send Tomy direct reports.

If so Whitt is done?

If he wants it.

It was very nice.

If so what was it?

I'm in Stan's office.

The troops just walked in.

Don't forget the wood.

It is no problem.

We are somewhat emasculated bystanders.

This seems fine to me.

I will tell them.

Are you back in town?

Check and find out form?

This is the crew.

Pressure to finish my review!

San Francisco was Interconnect meeting.

Mikey is invited also.

What are the units?

I am leaving the lake.

Did you mean Oxley?

Check with Vince Strohmeyer.

I'm taking Wednesday off.

I can get them.

I am monitoring email.

Call me anytime for information.

Will it be delivered?

Then they should go home.

Brian is working this.

Make sure they are current.

Not at this time.

Sheila please talk to Avashe.

Lisa now has everything.

I'm glad you are involved!

Thanks, having a good time.

Please set something up.

Stop working weekends again.

I vote for the latter.

Here is the message.

Yes, I will do so.

Talk to you soon.

It may be an hour.

We're on the way.

Even Michael was impressed.

Nice weather for it.

Cool is it not.

Is Derrick OK with it?

Did you differ from me?

Hang in there guys.

Didn't get a commitment.

Go ahead and notify.

I'll email later tonight.

All the kids were cute.

I agree with Morris.

Great job, Kevin.

Will you come get me?
